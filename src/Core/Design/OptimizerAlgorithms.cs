//  The optimizer's algorithm registry (brief-tuneopt-7 R-to7-7, overview D13): ONE list of what each
//  algorithm is called, when to use it, the options it reads with their defaults, which cost forms it
//  accepts and whether it differentiates. The Optimizer window's menu and tooltips, the `optimize`
//  directive's `algorithm=` summary, `check`, `reference tuning` (which the MCP reference serves
//  byte for byte) and the algorithms' own option defaults all read it — so none of them can describe
//  an algorithm, or a default, the others do not.
//
//  It is here, beside the setup that names an algorithm, because the `.cnl` reader and `check` read
//  the ids and src/Core references nothing above it. The algorithms themselves are numerics in
//  src/Engine/Optimization; `OptimizerFactory` there says which of these ids this build implements.
