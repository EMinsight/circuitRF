// brief-em3d-79 R-em3d79-3 — a harmonic-balance chain's run and its measurements: THE function the `hb` verb calls, and
// the one a thermal setup driven from a circuit calls, so a design's HB result is the same number either way (CLAUDE.md: an
// operation one surface re-implements diverges from the other silently).
//
// Two halves, because the verb prints between them (engine warnings, worker output, the WSProbe summary) and its stderr is
// a contract a script may be watching: Solve dispatches the chain — at the SWEEP when a parametric_sweep wraps the HB, since
// running the inner alone drops the sweep axis — and Measure evaluates the TestBench's `measure` lines against the result
// exactly as the GUI does, including the linear back-solver so a measure may name a linear-interior node.
