// brief-em3d-93 R-em3d93-2 — "Model": an object kept in the drawing and out of the solve.
//
// THE ELABORATION KEEPS IT; A SOLVE SEES THE FILTER. The editor builds its scene from the elaboration, and a not-modelled
// object must stay drawn, pickable and editable, so the elaborator lowers it as it lowers anything else and records its
// name in C3dElaboration.NotModelled (instance content by the instance's flag). Filter is the ONE place anything is taken
// out: the EM problem assembly (Palace and openEMS alike, air box included — C3dElaboration.Extent reads the filtered
// solids, so a not-modelled fixture far away does not grow the box) and the thermal run each call it, and nothing else
// filters. `em` and the thermal run from the CLI go through the same two callers.
//
// A REFERENCE TO A NOT-MODELLED OBJECT IS A REFUSAL, NEVER A SILENT DROP. A result that ran without something the user did
// not realise was missing is the outcome this feature must not create. Each refusal names both parties: a modelled wire on
// a pad that is not (here, in Filter); a modelled port on a conductor that is not (C3dPorts.Resolve, so the editor's port
// rows, check and the run all say it); a heat source, a probe, a contact resistance or a thermal boundary on an object that is
// not (C3dThermal's own validator, which check, the editor and the thermal run already share). A field plot's face on one is
// a warning: a plot is a reading and can simply show nothing.
//
// THE REFUSALS NOT-MODELLED CONTENT RAISED ITSELF DO NOT STOP A RUN. A lid that does not build, or an instance whose cell is
// missing, is exactly what a user turns off to run without; the elaborator records those (NotModelledRefusals) and Filter
// takes them out of the refusals a solve sees. The editor still shows them.
//
// PORTS ARE RENUMBERED, NOT GAPPED (owner decision D2b). A Touchstone file's ports are 1…N, so the modelled ports take 1…N
// in their Number order and the mapping is recorded in the notes, on each Em3dPort (SourceNumber) and so in the .sNp header
// and the .npy's diagnostics group. The document's numbers never change: turning P2 back on restores the four-port result.
// A port that is off is ABSENT — no excitation, no sheet, no lumped element (D2a): the gap is open, not terminated.
