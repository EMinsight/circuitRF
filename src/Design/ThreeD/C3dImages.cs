// brief-em3d-101 R-em3d101-1 — reference images in 3D: an image a sheet is drawn with (and, Phase B, one mapped onto a face).
//
// DRAWING ONLY. No solver, mesher, exporter or boolean reads an image: a sheet that carries one takes part in a solve exactly
// as any sheet does when it is modelled (C3dSheet.Model), and the image is the sheet's SURFACE in the view. So an image edit
// never makes a result stale (C3dPersistence.SerializeForRun leaves Image and Locked out) and an image sheet is not modelled
// when it is placed — a tracing underlay is not part of the design until someone says so.
//
// A REFERENCE, NEVER THE BYTES (R-em3d101-1b). The path is written relative to the .c3d when the file lies inside the .c3d's
// workspace, absolute otherwise, and it resolves against the .c3d that HOLDS it — an instance's content against the CHILD
// document. Store and Resolve below are the one spelling of that rule.
//
// ONE ORIENTATION RULE (R-em3d101-1c), here and nowhere else: a plane's (u, v) are the image's (right, up) — XY right +x up
// +y, XZ right +x up +z, YZ right +y up +z — which is how each plane reads from the standard view that looks at it (Top from
// +z, Front from −y, Right from +x; Camera3D's StandardView3D), so the picture is never mirrored there. The brief's
// "positive side" of XZ would be +y, from which (x, z) reads mirrored; the Front view is what anyone tracing an XZ drawing
// looks at it from, so that is the side the rule is written for (src/Design/RESOLVED.md).
