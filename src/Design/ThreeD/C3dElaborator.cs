// brief-em3d-42 R-em3d42-3/-4 — a .c3d elaborated: its objects and every instance below it, as the neutral
// problem's solids, sheets and materials in metres, with a provenance map back to the document.
//
// THE ONE RULE OF THE SERIES (overview §0): what the editor shows is what the solver gets. The editor will
// draw THIS, and the problem assembly (C3dProblemAssembly) solves THIS plus a setup. Elaboration is
// independent of any setup — the physics it needs (the sheet rule's top frequency, σ(T)'s temperature)
// comes in through C3dElaborationOptions, and with none a conductor with thickness is a solid.
//
// INSTANCES (R-em3d42-3c). A 3D view elaborates recursively; a layout view goes through Em3dLayoutSolids
// with the INSTANCE options and the layout's OWN technology (resolved from the layout's own path, never
// the parent's). ExternalWorkspaceGate is not consulted: that gate exists because a layout hierarchy
// matches layers by number, and nothing here matches by layer — every instance becomes metres and named
// materials before its parent sees it (overview §1i). The bottom of a layout's stackup sits at the
// instance's z.
//
// NAMES. An object inside an instance is `<instance>/<object>`, nested for depth; an array element is
// `<instance>[i,j,k]/<object>` (brief 49's ports name sub-cell conductors this way). Objects come first in
// construction order, then instances in theirs, each instance's content keeping its own relative order.
//
// MATERIALS (R-em3d42-3e). Each object's material resolves in its own document's technology. Equal values
// under one name merge; different values are kept as `<name>@<technology>` with a note listing both —
// a silent merge would give one of them the wrong conductivity, and nothing would look wrong. The
// technology is named by its .ctech file's stem (its display name may hold spaces and commas).
//
// BOND WIRES (brief-em3d-50). A drawn Wire resolves AFTER its document's objects and instances, because its ends land
// on conductors anywhere below it — a die pad in `U1`, a lead in the parent (C3dWires: the pad lookup, then the same
// Em3dWires.Resolve a .wBond's wires use). A wire that lands on no pad is refused by name and end, and the rest of the
// document still elaborates, so the editor can draw it and flag it (WireRefusals).
//
// KERNEL OBJECTS (brief-em3d-64 R-em3d64-3). A Boolean, Fillet, Chamfer or Step object is resolved, turned into the
// canonical tree (GeometryKernelTree), built by the geometry worker and lowered to ONE ordinary Em3dSolid whose primitive
// is an Em3dShapeSolid — material and role its Blank's. A build that fails is THAT object's refusal, never the
// document's, and never an undo: the rest elaborates and the edit stays. A DISABLED operation is as if it were not
// there: its operands elaborate as independent objects at its place in construction order, with no worker call. A
// document with no kernel object makes no worker call at all — the kernel is not even asked whether it is there.
//
// CACHING (R-em3d42-4), because the editor calls this on every edit. An elaborator instance keeps a
// per-OBJECT cache keyed by the object's serialized form, its world transform and its document's scale,
// and a per-CHILD cache keyed by (file, file stamp, view, technology stamp) — brief 28's rule: a file
// re-written at the same path is not the same file. ObjectsElaborated and ChildrenElaborated count
// misses, which is what gate 7 reads.
