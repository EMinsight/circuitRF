/// <summary>
/// A hand-written <c>.cnl</c>, read the way a schematic is extracted: its microstrip and via
/// instances take their substrate from the workspace technology, and its MMIC passives (AA-1) their
/// process.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> A schematic's microstrip resolves its substrate at extraction
/// (<see cref="MicrostripSubstrateInjection"/>, <see cref="ViaSubstrateInjection"/>), so the
/// <c>.cnl</c> a schematic becomes already states <c>H</c>, <c>Er</c> and the rest. A <c>.cnl</c>
/// written by hand did not go through extraction, and before this its <c>SignalLayer="Metal1"</c> was
/// accepted, resolved against nothing, and simulated on the models' standalone default — 1.6 mm of
/// εr 4.4 — inside a GaAs workspace, with <c>check</c> reporting nothing. The only sign was a
/// validity note about W/h. That is a converged, plausible, wrong answer, the failure the whole
/// automation surface exists to prevent.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The rule is the schematic's rule, applied to whatever the line leaves unstated.</b> A
/// substrate parameter the line states is the line's. One it leaves unstated follows the
/// technology — the netlist's own <c>technology "&lt;path&gt;"</c> statement when it has one (brief-artsch-6
/// R-as6-1), else the same walk-up a schematic in that folder would use (<see cref="SchematicTechnology"/>). The layer-choice
/// parameters (<c>SignalLayer</c>, <c>GroundReference</c>, <c>FromLayer</c>, <c>ToLayer</c>,
/// <c>GroundLayer</c>) are resolution INPUTS, so they are consumed here and never reach the engine,
/// exactly as the extractor drops them. A line that already states every substrate parameter, which
/// includes everything a schematic's extraction writes, is left exactly as it is.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Naming a layer with no technology to resolve it in is a refusal, not a fallback.</b> The
/// author asked for a stackup and a default substrate is not one. A layer the technology does not
/// have falls back to its default signal layer WITH A WARNING, exactly as a schematic's does, so a
/// netlist means the same thing whichever of the two it was written as. A line that named no layer,
/// outside any technology, keeps the standalone default it always had.</para>
///
/// <para>What this decided reaches <see cref="TestBench.ReadNotes"/> and
/// <see cref="TestBench.ReadWarnings"/>, which the elaborator forwards, so <c>check</c>, a run verb
/// and the Messages pane all report it.</para>
