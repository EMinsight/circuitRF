/// excludes it) or a workspace nobody has opened since a generator changed does not have it. The
/// flatten drops such an instance with a warning, and every verb after it gives a complete, plausible
/// answer for a board with parts missing. This rebuilds them first, through the same step the
/// application's open uses (<see cref="GeneratedCellsLifecycle.Rebuild"/>), and hands back the ones it
/// could not, so the caller can refuse.</para>
