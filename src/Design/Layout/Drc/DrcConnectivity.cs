// with different values, because two pieces of one net may sit closer than two that could short.
// Without net identity a checker has to pick one of the two values: the same-net value passes
// genuine shorts, and the different-net value fails correct artwork. Neither is acceptable, which
// is why v1 read those rules and did not enforce them.

// compare against a schematic, and does not extract devices. Those are separate questions and
// naming this class anything LVS-flavoured would invite the assumption that it answers them.
