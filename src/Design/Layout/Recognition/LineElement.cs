// What line recognition produces — brief-artsch-5-traces-to-line-elements.md; docs/design/artwork-to-schematic.md §6.
//
// Elements and the nodes between them, nothing more: AS-6 turns them into instance lines of a TestBench. The
// elements carry their parameters in SI (metres, ohms, hertz, dB/m; a bend's angle in degrees and its miter
// as MicrostripBendMiter's ordinal), named as the components name them, so AS-6 writes each one through
// without converting anything. The substrate is never among them: MLIN, its discontinuities, CPWG and SLIN
// take theirs from the technology at extraction, as a hand-placed one does (R-as5-7).
