/// enough: <b>every workspace that exists today was created before that function wrote one</b>, so
/// under creation-only they would never receive a <c>.gitignore</c> at all and would track results
/// forever. They are precisely the workspaces that matter — the ones with years of accumulated output
/// already in them. Three paths reach here: New Workspace, the first arming of an existing workspace,
/// and RC-6's ADOPTION of a user's repository (adoption because that is circuitRF taking
