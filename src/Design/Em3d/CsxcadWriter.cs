// brief-em3d-9 R-em3d9-2 — the resolved 3D problem and its FDTD grid as openEMS's CSXCAD XML.
//
// WRITTEN AS TEXT (R-em3d9-1a; em-3d.md §5.2). openEMS's Python and Octave interfaces are never used by
// product code: they link GPL code into the caller. The structural oracle is F0's case B XML, which
// upstream's own interface wrote (testdata/em3d/f0/B-via/openems/*/case.xml): the same property kinds,
// primitive kinds, port elements and probe types, compared by gate 5. Where they differ in structure,
// F0's file is right until shown otherwise.
//
// BYTE-DETERMINISTIC (overview rule 2): every number in round-trip form, '\n' on every platform,
// properties in construction order, nothing ordered by a hash. The same problem is the same bytes.
//
// WHAT CSXCAD CANNOT SAY, AND WHAT THIS WRITER DOES INSTEAD — every one reported on the run:
//   * No booleans (§6.5). Where solids overlap, the higher PRIORITY wins the cell, and the priority is
//     Em3dPrecedence's — metal over dielectric, then construction order within each (§6.3a; 3D editor
//     round 3) — computed from the problem once and never re-derived here (R-em3d9-2b).
//     A polygon's HOLE is the one subtraction inside a single solid; it is written as one KEYHOLE
//     polygon — the hole joined to the outline by a zero-width slit through the metal — which CSXCAD's
//     winding-number inside test reads exactly (the slit's two edges cancel, and a point on the slit is
//     metal, which it is).
//   * Dielectric loss (R-em3d9-2d). A constant conductivity reproduces tanδ at ONE frequency: κ =
//     σ + 2π·f_c·ε₀·εr·tanδ at the band centre f_c. Palace holds tanδ constant, so this is the largest
//     expected FEM/FDTD difference on a lossy substrate, and the note names f_c.
//   * Conductor loss. A sheet is a conducting sheet (σ, thickness) — the counterpart of Palace's
//     finite-conductivity boundary. A SOLID conductor is a perfect conductor: an FDTD grid cannot
//     resolve a metal's skin depth (F0 case A: 2.5 µm at 1 GHz in gold), and the notes name each one.
//   * Bond wires (§6.6). A hexagonal wire is the mitred prisms of Em3dTessellation as a polyhedron; a
//     round one is CSXCAD's own Wire primitive, which F0 validated (Q2: within 0.1 dB of Palace once the
//     grid step is half the radius). A wire thinner than the grid cell around it is written as a Curve —
//     openEMS's thin conductor on grid edges, whose effective radius is set by the cell, not the wire
//     (F0 Q2: 26 % too much inductance at 25 µm) — and the note names it.
//   * Absorbing faces are PML, in the PmlCells brief 8 added outside the box. A solid reaching an
//     absorbing face is continued through that PML, so the absorber sees the medium it terminates.
//
// PORTS (R-em3d9-2h) follow F0's upstream-written XML element for element: a lumped resistor on the
// port sheet, a voltage probe along its centre line, a current probe across its middle, and — in the
// excited port's file only — a soft E-field excitation. Probe names are port<k>_u / port<k>_i.
//
// WAVE PORTS (brief-em3d-116) are fed, probed lines: per terminal, a source shaped to the line on the source plane behind
// the face, voltage probes port<k>_ua/_u/_uc on three planes round the reference plane and current probes port<k>_ia/_ib
// between them, every coordinate an exact written grid line or the midpoint of two. Where they go is FdtdWavePorts'
// (src/Engine); the feed is lines FdtdGrid.Build already put in the grid, and a solid reaching the face is carried down it
// by the same Context.Out as through any absorbing face (a cylinder too, on a feed face only, so no lumped file changes).
//
// ONE MODEL, N FILES (R-em3d9-3b). Model() is the shared model; PortFile(k) is it with port k's
// excitation added as the LAST property, so the N files differ in exactly that element and no ID moves.
