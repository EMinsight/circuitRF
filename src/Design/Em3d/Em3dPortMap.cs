// brief-em3d-93 R-em3d93-1a — the record a result carries of which document port each of its ports is, when a port turned
// off (Model) left the rest renumbered 1…N. The notes say it too, but a Touchstone file is read by a netlist months later
// where the notes are gone (MIM-10's reason for the port lines), so the FILE carries it: one header line per port, and the
// .npy's diagnostics group a cube of the document numbers. Both writers — Palace's and openEMS's — call this, and both write
// nothing extra when no port was renumbered, so every result written before this is byte-identical.
