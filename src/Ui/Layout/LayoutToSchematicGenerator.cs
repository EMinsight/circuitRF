/// PCell-backed instances (<see cref="PCellOrigin"/> non-null) push their PARAMETERS back as well as
/// creating a component; an ORDINARY hierarchical instance — a hand-drawn cell placed in this layout —

/// layout could have moved.

/// <para><b>The ordinary-cell half was missing entirely until 2026-08-17</b> (owner: "I performed an
/// Update Schematic from Layout, but my cell instance was not placed in the schematic — even though it
/// has a symbol"). The original scope note here reasoned that such an instance had "no existing symbol
/// this command could safely fabricate", and that premise is simply wrong: a schematic component
/// references a cell by <see cref="EditableComponent.CellRef"/> and resolves that cell's own primary
/// <c>.csym</c> at render time — exactly what dropping the cell from the Library palette produces
/// (<c>SchematicViewModel.CommitCellPlacementAsync</c>). Nothing is fabricated, so nothing had to be
