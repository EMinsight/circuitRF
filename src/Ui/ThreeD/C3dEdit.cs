// brief-em3d-43 R-em3d43-1c — one undo entry of the 3D editor.
//
// AN ENTRY STORES ONLY WHAT IT CHANGED: each touched object (or instance) as the file spells it, before and
// after — never a snapshot of the document, so a 10,000-object document does not copy itself per edit. The
// spelling is C3dPersistence's own, which is also the elaborator's per-object cache key: an undone object
// is byte for byte what it was, and its elaboration is a cache hit.
//
// ONE SHAPE PER ENTRY — replacements, or removals, or insertions — so an index always means one thing:
// a replacement's and a removal's index is into the list BEFORE the entry, an insertion's into the list
// AFTER it. Removals run from the highest index down and insertions from the lowest up, which is what
// makes deleting three objects and undoing it put each back where it was.
