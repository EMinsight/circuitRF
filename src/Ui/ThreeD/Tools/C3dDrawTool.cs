// brief-em3d-45 R-em3d45-3 / -4 — what every drawing tool is: a small state machine fed clicks and typed values,
// which shows a rubber band while it runs and hands back ONE object when it finishes.
//
// A TOOL NEVER TOUCHES THE DOCUMENT. It is given points (C3dDrawInput, resolved by the editor from the snap and the
// cursor's ray) and returns what it made; the editor inserts that as one undo entry. So a cancelled gesture adds no
// entry (gate 8), and the preview is the overlay's, never the scene's.
//
// EVERY TYPED DIMENSION LANDS IN EXACTLY ONE STORED FIELD (R-em3d45-4a): a box's Size component, a rectangle's Size,
// a cylinder's Radius or Length, a prism's Height — the fields brief 51 will bind an expression to. The typed
// field's parser is one function answering "an exact DBU value" or "this is an expression" (C3dDimension.Parse).
