// brief-em3d-43 — the 3D editor: a .c3d document, and the 3D pane drawing its elaboration.
//
// WHAT THE EDITOR SHOWS IS WHAT THE SOLVER GETS (overview §0). The scene is built from C3dElaborator's
// output — the same elaboration C3dProblemAssembly hands a solver — through Scene3DBuilder, under brief
// 28's generation numbers, never from a second picture of the document. An edit changes the document,
// which is elaborated again; the elaborator's per-object cache makes that ONE object's work, the builder's
// tessellation cache makes it one object's tessellation, and the session's patch makes it one object's
// upload (R-em3d43-1b, gate 6). The document has no setup yet (brief 49), so no air box is drawn.
//
// THE PANE IS THE VIEWER'S (R-em3d43-1a): Viewer3DViewModel with this class as its IViewer3DEditHost. The
// build runs on the thread pool from a SNAPSHOT (the document's own text) taken on the UI thread, so the
// document is never read while it is being edited; the elaborator is serialised by a lock, since two
// generations may overlap for a moment and its caches are not thread-safe.
//
// UNDO (R-em3d43-1c): one entry per user action, storing only what it changed (C3dEdit). A GESTURE — a
// drag, from brief 46 on — edits the document as it goes and commits ONE entry on release (BeginGesture).
// The display unit is a document PREFERENCE, not geometry (owner decision D4): changing it dirties the
// document and is saved, but adds no undo entry, elaborates nothing and moves nothing (gate 10).
