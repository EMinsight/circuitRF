// brief-em3d-108 — appearance, edited where it lives, seen live.
//
// R-em3d108-1d — THE DISPLAY-ONLY RELOAD. A technology (or a library it names) changes; until now every open 3D view re-elaborated.
// When the technology as it is NOW equals the one the scene was elaborated with in its canonical physics form (C3dRunDocument.
// PhysicsText — every material's Source, Color and Appearance cleared), nothing a solver reads moved: the kept elaboration is
// re-assembled into a scene with the new technology (Build's second half, Assemble), so the looks are resolved again and a changed
// Color recolours vertices — a buffer patch — with no elaboration and no tessellation (every primitive is in the cache). Any physical
// change, a build already in flight, a pushed-in frame or a boolean's preview takes today's path. A result stays current either way,
// since a run's manifest hashes the technology in the same physics form (brief 105 §5).
//
// R-em3d108-2 — THE INSPECTOR'S APPEARANCE GROUP writes ONE FIELD of each selected object's or instance's override, as one undo entry
// (C3dEditSlot, the Transparency row's). A slider drag previews with no write: the viewer restyles its scene under an override map
// (Viewer3DViewModel.PreviewObjectAppearances) — a slot re-intern and a shade-stream patch — and the release writes once.
