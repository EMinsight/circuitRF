// brief-em3d-98 — which of this 3D view's setups have a current result: C3dSolveStatus's answer (the one function every surface
// reads), kept here for the setup list, the document tab's glyphs, the workspace tree row and a floating window's title.
//
// NO CHECK EVER DELAYS AN OPEN OR AN EDIT (R-em3d98-6). The document is checked in the background: after the first frame, then
// after ~500 ms of quiet following an edit, and at once when a run finishes. The one thing taken on the UI thread is the
// document's text (a copy, so the worker never reads a model the user is editing); the comparison, the hashing and the file
// reads are the worker's. A drag writes no document (brief-em3d-47), so it never triggers one.
//
// The open document is checked against its IN-MEMORY model, unsaved edits included, as the stale banner is; pushed into a
// nested view, the tab is still the TOP document's, so that is what is checked.
