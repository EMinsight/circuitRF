// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-2d / R-em3d28-3 / R-em3d28-4 — the 3D view's state: what scene it shows,
// which overlays are on, what the toolbar's buttons do, and the object tree.
//
// THE THREE LOOPS (em-3d.md §8.4), and which of them this class is in:
//   * the INPUT loop is here, on the UI thread — pointer and key events become small changes to the
//     Viewer3DViewState (a camera, a cursor, a flag) and a request for a frame. It computes no geometry;
//     gate 5 counts that a thousand hovers cause no tessellation and no problem generation.
//   * the FRAME loop is the pane's render thread (Viewer3DPane), which reads that state;
//   * the KERNEL loop is Scene3DSource: a change to the .cem, the layout, the technology or the .wBond
//     regenerates the problem in the background, and the view keeps drawing the last finished scene.
//
// Read only (R-em3d28-5): nothing here writes the .cem. The .c3d editor (brief-em3d-43, src/Ui/ThreeD) is
// this same view model built with a scene builder of its own and an IViewer3DEditHost — one pane, two uses.
