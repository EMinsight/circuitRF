// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-1b — the 3D pane: composition GPU interop (em-3d.md §8.3), in the spike's
// InteropPane shape, which passed every counter on the owner's Mac.
//
//   * a RENDER THREAD of its own draws each frame into a free image of a three-image swapchain;
//   * the swapchain is imported into the compositor ONCE (and again only on a resize or a re-host);
//   * the UI thread's share of a frame (OnTick) is handing the finished image over and planning the
//     next — it never touches geometry and never waits on the GPU.
//
// So the compositor's share of a 3D frame is placing a finished image, and a frame still rendering or a
// problem still regenerating leaves the previous image up: the rest of the window cannot be starved by
// it (the lesson of "the whole UI crawled", src/Ui/RESOLVED.md).
//
// INPUT (R-em3d28-4a, brief-em3d-43 R-em3d43-2a): orbit = left drag; pan = middle drag, right drag or
// Alt + left drag; a click selects and Shift-click adds or removes; a right-CLICK (no drag) opens the
// selection's context menu; zoom to the cursor = wheel or pinch. The keys are the view model's
// (Viewer3DViewModel.HandleKey): O / F / V the selection mode, B / Shift+B next behind / in front, Home
// fits, P toggles the projection, 1–7 the standard views, C the clip plane, A the axis indicator, Esc
// cancels the gesture in progress or clears the selection. A trackpad's two-finger scroll zooms and its pinch zooms (macOS). No
// modal dialog opens mid-gesture (§8.2 point 5): nothing here opens a dialog at all.
//
// A present step that cannot signal is a FAULT (Viewer3DPresentFault): the pane stops, says why in
// its place, and never loops (R-em3d28-1d).
