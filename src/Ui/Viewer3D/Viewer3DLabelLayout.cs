// General designer feedback round 14 — the 3D view's labels (probes, heat sources, mesh regions, effective blocks, ports) were each
// drawn up and to the right of their point with no regard for one another. Probes on one solid share its centre, two probes on
// one face share a point exactly, and a Front or Side view lines a whole stack up on one vertical: the names landed on top of
// each other and could not be read. This places them so no two overlap.
//
// Greedy, in a fixed order (top of the screen first, then left), so a still view always lays out the same way. Each label tries
// the four corners round its point — up-right first, which is where every label used to go — then slides away from it, up and
// down, a label's height at a time. A label that had to move away from its point gets a leader line back to it. The points
// themselves (the probe diamonds) are obstacles too, so a label never covers another label's marker.
