// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-1b — route A on Linux: native Vulkan through Vortice.Vulkan's MANAGED bindings
// (MIT; the loader, libvulkan.so.1, is the system's or the driver's). No native package (R-em3d28-1c).
//
// Lifted from tools/Viewer3dSpike's Vulkan half (brief 28 step 0, findings §8), whose harness passed on
// Linux arm64 under Mesa's software driver (0 B per orbit frame, 0 B managed allocation per frame, the
// pick reads back the right object, and its frame matches Metal's pixel for pixel to a mean 0.095).
// What the presentation path must be was read from Avalonia 12.0.3's own importers, not assumed:
//   * The image is exported as an OPAQUE POSIX FD. Avalonia's Vulkan compositor RE-CREATES the image
//     from it with fixed parameters — R8G8B8A8, optimal tiling, usage TRANSFER_SRC | TRANSFER_DST |
//     SAMPLED | COLOR_ATTACHMENT, MUTABLE_FORMAT, one mip, a DEDICATED allocation whose size must equal
//     MemorySize — and an opaque handle only imports into an identically-created image, so ours is made
//     exactly so.
//   * Both importers assume the image is in TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL when their wait completes (the Vulkan
//     one transitions to it once and reads from it; the GLX one waits its semaphore with
//     GL_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_EXT). So every frame's render pass ends in TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL.
//   * Synchronisation is BINARY semaphores, a pair per image: "ready" (we signal it when the frame is
//     done) and "released" (the compositor signals it when it has read the image). A binary semaphore
//     may be waited only after its signal was SUBMITTED, so before the GPU waits "released" the render
//     thread sees the compositor's update task complete; one that has not is a fault, never a loop.
//   * Each import takes ownership of its fd, so a fresh fd is exported for every import.
//   * The GLX compositor (Avalonia's Linux default) offers these handles only when the GL driver has
//     BOTH GL_EXT_memory_object_fd and GL_EXT_semaphore_fd; Mesa's software GL has only the first, and
//     Avalonia refuses it for GLX anyway — a software stack cannot host this pane.
//   * The device is matched to the compositor's by UUID (ICompositionGpuInterop.DeviceUuid).
//
// The shader is the generated scene.spv (Shaders/): one module, four entry points. tools/ShaderGen
// writes it with naga's ADJUST_COORDINATE_SPACE, which negates clip-space y in the vertex shader — so
// the image comes out upright with the SAME view-projection the Metal and D3D11 backends use. FlipY is
// therefore FALSE here, and a triangle keeps the on-screen winding it has on the other two APIs, so
// the front face is COUNTER-CLOCKWISE as it is there (the shader's front_facing draws the clip caps).
//
// Per frame the 400-byte uniform block (brief 29 added the field block) is copied into a persistently-mapped, host-coherent ring and
// bound as a dynamic uniform buffer — counted as uniform bytes, never geometry. Three frames in flight,
// each with its own command buffer, fence and 1×1 pick readback buffer, read when its fence has
// signalled, never waited for.
