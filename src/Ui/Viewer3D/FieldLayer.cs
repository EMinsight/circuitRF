// brief-em3d-96 R-em3d96-2 — ONE DRAWN PLOT'S field state. The viewer draws up to four plots at once (D1); each is a layer:
// its request, the run it reads, the solution and quantity it shows, the step it loaded, the triangles it built, its own range
// and the range its group shares (D2), its text, its problem, and its own build — a newer request for THIS plot cancels an
// older one of this plot, never another plot's. With no plot the viewer has one layer of its own (brief 29's view, Name null),
// driven by the toolbar properties.
//
// The steps a layer loads are the viewer's (Viewer3DViewModel.StepOf, cached by file), so two plots of one solution read the
// volume once. The phase is not a layer's: one clock animates every layer (Viewer3DViewModel.WriteFieldUniforms).
