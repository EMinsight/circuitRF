// ================================================================
//  EnvelopeBaseband.cs  —  a non-affine element across the baseband envelope
//
//  The baseband product (k = 0) recovers C from stamps at 1 Hz and 2 Hz,
//  which is exact for a stamp affine in jw.  A line's Y stamp is not: it
//  goes as 1/(jw L) there, so its slope at DC comes out ~1/(dlt^2 L) —
//  ~1e15 for a 25-ohm quarter-wave line at 1 GHz — and swamped the 0.02 S
//  terminations until the LU found no pivot (E = 90-450 deg failed; longer
//  lines, with more L, only just survived).  Such an element is HELD at
//  its DC stamp for the baseband product instead: exact at DC, where the
//  bias is, and the stamp the DC solve and the harmonic-balance start
//  already use, so the run still starts at its own equilibrium.  What is
//  lost is its frequency dependence across the baseband band, and the run
//  warns, naming it, when that is large enough to matter.
//
//  An element is held only when its own baseband tangent is not exact, so
//  R/L/C, the sources and a fitted block never are, and a lumped circuit's
//  run is unchanged bit for bit — and only when its DC stamp is closer to
//  it across the band than the tangent is, so a nearly affine element (a
//  wBond, whose skin effect bends it slightly) keeps its tangent.  A two-conductor line is never held in an
//  envelope run either: it is stepped as its delay (EnvelopeLineDelay),
//  exact across the baseband for a lossless line.  What is still held is
//  a block whose rational fit was refused, and a coupled line, which is
//  never fitted (held shorted, below).
//
//  A LINE is not held at its w = 0 stamp: that is the resonance clamp of
//  its 1/(jw L) pole, a ~2e7 S purely IMAGINARY admittance, and the k = 0
//  envelope is real everywhere else (the interface currents and the
//  injections are projected to their real part), so a complex baseband
//  matrix behind a real projection is not passive and grew x4.8 a step
//  (src/Engine/RESOLVED.md, brief ENV-TLIN).  A line is held at what it is
//  at DC instead (IDcShortedTerminals): its terminal pairs shorted, by a
//  branch V_a = V_b exactly as an inductor is at DC.  The branch exists in
//  every product — I = 0 while not holding — so every product and the
//  harmonic-balance start have the same unknowns.
