// brief-em3d-116 — a wave port on openEMS, as a fed and probed transmission line (R-em3d116-1, -2).
//
// HOW IT WORKS is how openEMS's own authors build a line port, which brief 113-a reproduced and measured
// (src/Design/RESOLVED.md § "Terminal wave ports — brief-em3d-113-a"). Written from the physics and those
// measurements, never from openEMS's code (em-3d.md §5.2). Each TERMINAL (a one-terminal wave port is one) is
// fed from behind, on a uniform continuation of its line, by a soft E-field source shaped to the line; its
// voltage is measured on three planes around the reference plane and its current on the two half-cell planes
// between them. S then comes from all the runs at once, through FdtdPortTransform.Solve, unchanged. No mode is
// computed.
//
// TWO STAGES, because the feed must exist before the grid and the probes must sit on the grid:
//   Plan  (FdtdGrid.Build calls it) — per air-box face carrying a wave port: what each terminal is (coaxial,
//         stripline, microstrip, or a plain line), the feed length, and the uniform lattice of FIXED lines from
//         one cell outside the source to one cell past the reference plane. Those lines are what make the
//         extension exist: CsxcadWriter already carries every solid reaching an absorbing face out to the grid's
//         edge (its Context.Out), so a grid that reaches past the face extrudes the face's cross-section
//         through the feed and on through the PML.
//   Place (CsxcadWriter calls it) — every source and probe coordinate as an exact written grid line, or the
//         exact midpoint of two (113-a: an off-line zero-thickness source is dropped with only a warning, and a
//         current-loop edge on an unresolved tie snapped into a strip and read 55 % of the current).
