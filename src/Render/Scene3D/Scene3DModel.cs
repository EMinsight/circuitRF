// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-1a / R-em3d28-2b — the scene a 3D view draws: flat vertex and index arrays,
// object IDs, material slots, visibility defaults and a generation number. No GPU API, no Avalonia.
//
// ONE VERTEX BUFFER, ONE INDEX BUFFER, ONE LINE BUFFER for the whole scene, uploaded once per
// generation (§8.2 point 1). Each object's triangles are CONTIGUOUS in the index buffer, so an object
// is one draw whatever its triangle count: a draw per (object, material), never per face (gate 2). A
// solid has exactly one material, so in practice that is a draw per object.
//
// VERTICES ARE SCENE-LOCAL. Em3dProblem is in metres; a board is 0.1 m across and its features are a
// micrometre. Single precision at 0.1 m resolves ~6 nm, but only if the numbers are small — so every
// position is stored relative to Origin (the bounds' centre, in double), and the camera lives in the
// same frame.
