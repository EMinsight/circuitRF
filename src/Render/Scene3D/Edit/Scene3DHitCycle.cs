// brief-em3d-43 R-em3d43-4b — B and Shift+B: layout's R13 overlap cycling (layout-view.md §6.2), in depth.
//
// The list and the cursor point it was built at are CACHED: B advances, Shift+B goes back, both wrapping at
// the ends. It is discarded — and the next B builds a new one — when the cursor moves more than a few
// pixels, the scene changes (a new generation), or the mode changes; each discard is counted, which is
// what gate 4 reads. The FIRST B after a click starts from the clicked item's place in the list, so B from
// the top face of a stack goes to the face just behind it, not back to the front.
