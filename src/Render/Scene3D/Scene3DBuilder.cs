// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-2 — the scene from the problem, through the one tessellation (R-em3d5-1).
//
// Everything is tessellated by Em3dTessellation, so the viewer's surfaces are the section renderer's,
// the CSXCAD writer's and the size estimate's: three consumers already agree on where a wire's surface
// is, and the viewer does not make a fourth answer.
//
// COLOURS (R-em3d28-2c). A conductor is painted with its drawing layer's colour from the technology,
// resolved by Em3dSectionRenderer.ObjectColours — the function brief 5's pictures use, so a via is the
// same colour in the 2D section, the layout editor and here. Dielectrics, air and the air-box faces
// take the fixed palette below, one set for the light variant and one for the dark, which is how the
// 2D editors follow the application theme. Ports take the theme's pin colour, as in the section view.
//
// FACES AND EDGES (brief-em3d-43 R-em3d43-3a / -5). Every vertex carries the face it lies on, so a vertex
// the tessellation shares between two faces (a box's corner is on three) is emitted once PER FACE: flat
// interpolation takes the face from one vertex, and a shared one would give a triangle its neighbour's
// face. Shading is flat already (the fragment shader's derivative normal), so nothing looks different. A
// sheet is one face, 0. Each solid and sheet also gets its FEATURE EDGES — where two of its faces meet,
// or a sheet's boundary — in the line buffer, drawn only when selected (the Object-mode outline).
//
// EDIT LOCALITY (R-em3d43-1b). With a Scene3DTessellationCache, a solid whose primitive is the same as
// last build's is not tessellated again: the elaborator hands back its cached primitive for an unchanged
// object, so an edit to one object of a thousand tessellates one. An editor also fixes the ORIGIN, so
// an edit that does not move the bounds' centre leaves every other object's vertex bytes identical — which
// is what lets the session upload only the changed ranges (Scene3DPatch).
//
// THE PALETTE, documented because it is a user-visible choice: dielectrics cycle through six hues in
// problem order (green, blue, amber, violet, teal, rose) at 35 % opacity, so a stack of two substrates
// is two colours; air is a pale blue at 8 %; an air-box face is grey for PEC, blue for absorbing,
// orange for PMC and violet for symmetry.
