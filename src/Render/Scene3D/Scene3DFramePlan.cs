// brief-em3d-28 R-em3d28-1 / §8.4's frame loop — WHAT one frame draws, decided below the firewall.
//
// A GPU backend (src/Ui/Viewer3D) is plumbing: it binds the buffers it uploaded for a generation,
// writes the uniform block, and issues the draws this plan lists, in order. Every decision — which
// objects are visible, the back-to-front order of the translucent ones, what hover and selection
// highlight, where the clip plane is, whether this frame carries a pick — is made here, once, for all
// three backends. So a later headless `render` of a 3D view can reuse it, and the gates can count
// draws without a GPU.
//
// ZERO ALLOCATION PER FRAME. Plan() writes into arrays sized when the scene changed; the translucent
// sort is in place. The frame loop is near-zero managed work (§8.4 point 1), which is also what keeps
// the owner's Debug build responsive.
