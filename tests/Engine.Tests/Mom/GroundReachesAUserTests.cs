// CL7 — the ground plane reaches a user. `docs/sonnet-briefs/brief-conductor-loss-7-ground-reaches-a-user.md`;
// findings in `src/Engine/Mom/RESOLVED.md` §CL7.
//
// CL4 built a conducting ground plane on the general kernel and CL6 built it on the one-slab one.
// Every gate passed and NO RUN A USER COULD MAKE GOT ONE, because `PlanarExtractor` wrote
// `Termination.Pec` into both media. This file gates the flip.
//
//   R-cl7-1  A PERFECT floor is bit-identical to pre-CL7, through `PlanarSolve` rather than through
//            the kernel — which is what says the move came from the plane and not from something
//            else in the same commit. `PlanarProblem.WithPerfectGround` is the spelling, and it is NOT
//            `PlanarFillSettings.PerfectConductor` (that makes the STRIP perfect, CL4 §8).
//   R-cl7-2  Against kernel A, both surfaces lossy, gating the TERM and never the SHARE.
//   R-cl7-3  Milestone 0 — where the quasi-static path's γ gets its GROUND term, measured on CL3
//            §0's own instrument at four frequencies and four meshes on both starters.
//   R-cl7-4  Milestone 0b — the size of what the power budget's dielectric line was carrying.
//   R-cl7-5  Passivity and reciprocity with a DIRECTION check; loss may only increase.
