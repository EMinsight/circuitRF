  == circuitRF Windows installer builder ========================================

    .\packaging\windows\build-windows.ps1

  With no arguments it builds EVERYTHING this platform ships - all three architectures, both
  install scopes, and the update payload:

    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-x64.msi              perMachine, %ProgramFiles%       notify-only
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-arm64.msi
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-x86.msi
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-x64-user.msi     perUser, %LOCALAPPDATA%          updates itself
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-arm64-user.msi
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-x86-user.msi
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-x64.zip          the update payload
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-arm64.zip
    dist\circuitRF-<VERSION>-win-x86.zip

  Narrow it only when you mean to:

    .\packaging\windows\build-windows.ps1 -Arch x64
    .\packaging\windows\build-windows.ps1 -Scope perUser
    .\packaging\windows\build-windows.ps1 -Arch arm64 -Scope perMachine

  WHY THE DEFAULT IS EVERYTHING. This script used to build ONE architecture in ONE scope per run,
  which meant a complete Windows release was six invocations and looked like three. A release cut
  that way ships the notify-only .msi files and silently omits the .zip the updater fetches - so
  nobody on Windows is offered the next version, and, because UpdateSelector needs a matching asset
  before it will even post the notify-only line, nobody is TOLD about it either. That happened
  (1.0.0-beta.2). A release script whose obvious invocation produces an incomplete release is the
  script's bug, not the operator's, so the obvious invocation now produces all of it.

  ONE PUBLISH SERVES BOTH SCOPES. The two differ in where the files go and what the shortcuts point
  at, never in the files themselves, so an architecture is published once and packaged twice. That
  is also why -Scope narrows the packaging and not the build.

  <VERSION> is the contents of the repo-root VERSION file; see BUILDING.md.

  Requires: .NET 10 SDK and the WiX CLI -

      dotnet tool install --global wix

  The WixToolset.UI.wixext extension is installed BY THIS SCRIPT if it is missing, pinned to the
  wix version actually on PATH. Adding it by hand is what produced "error WIX0144: The extension
  'WixToolset.UI.wixext' could not be found": the extension cache is keyed by wix version, so an
  extension added under one wix and a `dotnet tool update` later do not see each other.

  Run it from the repository root, in PowerShell.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  THIS FILE MUST STAY PURE ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a .ps1 with no byte-order mark as
  ANSI (cp1252), not UTF-8. A UTF-8 emoji or box-drawing character then decodes to bytes 0x93/0x94,
  which are the CURLY QUOTES U+201C/U+201D - and PowerShell honours those as string delimiters. The
  script does not fail: it silently reinterprets as a string everything from the stray quote to the
  next one, PRINTS that block instead of running it, and carries on. That is what made an entire
  publish step vanish while the build appeared to continue. tests/Ui.Tests/PackagingScriptTests.cs
  holds this shut.

#
# Harvesting rather than listing by hand is what keeps the installer correct when the published set
# changes - the app ships its user documentation as loose files, and the native SkiaSharp/HarfBuzz
# DLLs come and go with the single-file settings.

# -Force on BOTH enumerations below, and it is not belt-and-braces. A workspace's manifest is a
# dotfile named literally `.cws`, and so is `.ccell` beside every cell - Windows does not infer the
# hidden ATTRIBUTE from a leading dot, but anything that has ever touched these files with a tool
# that does (a git checkout under some shells, an extracted archive, a synced folder) leaves it set,
# and without -Force those files are skipped in silence. The installer would then carry the example
# workspaces' cells and none of their manifests, and Tools > Examples would be empty on the
# installed copy with nothing anywhere saying why. The examples are the reason it is here; every
# other published file is unaffected.

The device worker is missing from the publish tree.

circuitRF builds it during 'dotnet build', but only warns when no C compiler is present - so this
machine has none that the build could use. Install one of these and run this script again:

    zig      (winget install zig.zig)   - one download, no daemon; the preferred route
    MSYS2/MinGW x86-64 gcc
    Docker or Podman, plus a bash (Git for Windows ships one)

The worker is built for x86-64 even on an ARM machine, deliberately: it exists to load vendor model
libraries, those are x64, and a process holds one instruction set. Windows runs it translated.

    # == The OSDI worker ===========================================================

    # 2026-09, so every Windows installer circuitRF has released shipped without it, and placing a
    # compiled model refused naming a helper the user had no way to obtain.
    #
    # BOTH ARCHITECTURES, on every Windows package, and that is not a copy of the arch loop above.
    # This worker LoadLibrary()s the user's own compiled model, so it must match THE MODEL'S
    # architecture, not circuitRF's - and an arm64 Windows machine routinely runs a translated x64
    # Verilog-A compiler, whose output is x64. Shipping one of the pair leaves the other's users with
    # a helper that cannot load anything they can compile.
    #
    # Set CRF_ALLOW_NO_DEVICE_WORKER=1 to package without it on purpose; it covers both helpers.

    # osdi-worker.exe is the third of them and it is NOT a duplicate of the pair: it is the copy a

The OSDI worker is missing from the publish tree.

circuitRF builds it during 'dotnet build' (tools\osdi-worker\build.cmd), but only warns when no C
compiler is present. Install zig and run this script again:

    zig      (winget install zig.zig)

zig is named on its own here rather than as one of several: it targets both x86-64 and arm64 from
either kind of machine, and both are needed. A single-target compiler (an MSYS2/MinGW gcc, a clang
without cross targets) builds only the architecture it runs on, which is half of what ships.

    # ONE run of this script publishes all three architectures from a single machine. 1.0.0-beta.16
    # therefore shipped an arm64 flat worker in the x86 and x64 payloads as well, and nothing
    # downstream notices: VerilogAFileResolver reads each candidate's PE header and prefers the
    # arch-suffixed pair, so only the bare-command route fails, on a user's machine, launching a
    # binary the processor cannot execute.

    # x86 expects the x64 worker. No 32-bit worker is built, and the worker is a separate process
    # whose architecture has to match the MODEL rather than circuitRF - see build.cmd's own note.
