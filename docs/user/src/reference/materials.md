A **material** is a named record of values: a relative permittivity, a conductivity, a thermal conductivity, a colour, a
look. Every stackup entry, 3D solid, bond wire and air box names one, and every solver reads its values from it.
Nothing is a dielectric or a conductor by nature: **what a material states decides what it is.** Stating εr makes it
a dielectric, stating σ₂₀ makes it a conductor, and a value left empty is *not stated* — never zero. Where a material is
used decides what it must state, and `check` says when it does not: a thermal run, for instance, refuses a solid whose
material states no thermal conductivity.

This chapter is in three parts: [where materials are kept](#cmat-and-ctech), which is the part people find confusing;
[entering a material](#new) in the Materials editor, card by card; and [renaming and deleting](#delete) one.

## Where materials are kept: .ctech and .cmat {#cmat-and-ctech}

There are two kinds of file a material can live in, and they hold **exactly the same record**:

- **A technology (`.ctech`)** is your process: its layers, its stackup, its design rules — and its **own list of
  materials**. See [Technology](layout-editor.html#technology) and [Stackup](stackup.html).
- **A material library (`.cmat`)** holds materials and nothing else (and the thermal contact resistances between pairs
  of them; see [Thermal](thermal.html)). It is not a design, has no layers, and is never used on its own.

The two are joined in **one direction only: a technology names its libraries.** It lists each `.cmat` by a path
relative to the `.ctech`, so a workspace moved or copied as a whole still finds them. Several technologies may name the
same library, and that is what a library is for — one list of laminates, or one company's characterised metals, shared
by every process that uses them. A workspace, a schematic, a layout, an EM setup and a 3D view **never** name a library
themselves; they name a technology, and the technology brings its libraries. That is what makes one technology give the
same answer everywhere it is used.

**What a design sees** is the technology's own materials **plus** every material of every library it names, as one
list. There is **no order of precedence** between them. A name may appear in more than one place only if every copy
states the **same values**; then they are one material. If two copies differ, there is no right answer to pick, so the
technology **does not load**: `check` reports `material.conflict`, naming the material and both files, and the
technology's Materials tab says the same. Make the values equal, or rename one.

{{ui: materials-technology-tab}}

**A material belongs to one file, and is edited there.** On a technology's Materials tab its own materials are edited in
place; a library's rows are listed below them, read-only, because a change to a library changes every technology that
names it. *Edit in generic-materials.cmat* on such a row, or **Open Library**, opens the library as its own document,
with its own undo and its own Save. The strip at the foot of the tab manages which libraries the technology names:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Add Library…** | Names an existing `.cmat` — stored relative to this `.ctech`. |
| **New Library…** | Writes an empty `.cmat` beside the technology and names it. |
| **Add Generic Materials** | Copies circuitRF's generic library beside the technology and names it. A different file of that name already there is never overwritten; you are told to rename or move it. |
| **Open Library** | Opens that library as its own document. |
| **Remove** | Stops naming the library. The file itself is left where it is. |

A `.cmat` also appears in the **Project Tree** beside the technologies; double-click it to open it.

**Which to use.** Put a material in the technology's own list when it belongs to that process alone — the MIM dielectric
of one wafer process, say. Put it in a library when more than one technology should share it, so that a corrected value
is corrected once.

**The generic library.** circuitRF ships `generic-materials.cmat`: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, laminates, glass,
die-attach and thermal materials, every value with its source. When **New Workspace** copies a shipped technology, it
copies the libraries that technology names beside it. From then on the copy is the **workspace's own file**: you may edit
it, and a later circuitRF release never changes it. The package button in the editor's toolbar lists the same materials
as **built-in**; assigning or editing a built-in material copies it into one of your lists, where it is yours from then
on.

## The Materials editor {#editor}

One editor shows materials everywhere they can be edited, and it opens in three places:

- **A `.cmat` document** — the library itself (double-click it in the Project Tree, or *Open Library*).
- **A technology's Materials tab** — its own materials, then its libraries' rows below them.
- **The Materials dialog of a 3D view** — *Assign Material…*, *New Material…*, or *Edit…* beside the Inspector's
  Material box; see [The 3D Editor](drawing-in-3d.html#view). Edits there go to the file each material belongs to when
  you press **OK**, as an unsaved change in that file.

On the left is the list: one row per material, with its colour, its name, what it is (*Dielectric*, *Conductor*,
*Air*, *States nothing*, or *Ambiguous* — it states both εr and σ₂₀, so an object made of it must be given a
**Role** in the 3D view) and the file it comes from. **Filter** narrows the list by name, role or file. On the right
is everything the selected material states, on one form, in cards: **Dielectric**, **Conductor**, **Thermal**,
**Appearance** and **Notes**. A row's swatch is the material's colour: its ordinary-view colour when one is set, else its
base colour in the realistic view.

Every field commits when you press **Enter** or leave it; **Escape** puts the shown value back. Each change is one undo
step, and nothing reaches the disk until you **Save** the file it belongs to. An empty field is *not stated* and is left
out of the file.

## Entering a new material {#new}

The example below adds a laminate, *My laminate*, to a `.cmat`. The steps are the same on a technology's Materials tab.

**1. Add it and name it.** Press **＋ New**. A row called *Material1* is added and selected, with its name ready to be
typed over. Type the name and press Enter. A name is unique within the technology, ignoring case, and `@` is reserved.
**Duplicate** instead copies the selected material — every value and table — under a new name, which is the quick way to
make a variant of something that already exists.

When the editor holds more than one list (a technology tab with libraries, or the 3D view's dialog), *New, duplicated and
built-in materials go to* chooses which file a new material is written to.

**2. Say what it is.** For a dielectric, type its **relative permittivity εr** and **loss tangent tan δ** on the
Dielectric card; **μr** is needed only for a magnetic material. The chip beside the name changes to *Dielectric*. For a
metal, type its **conductivity σ₂₀** at 20 °C on the Conductor card instead, and its **temperature coefficient α₂₀** if a
3D setup or a thermal run should follow its temperature: σ(T) = σ₂₀ / (1 + α₂₀ (T − 20 °C)).

{{ui: materials-new}}

**3. Say where the values come from.** Every solver takes εr and tan δ as constants, so the **Notes** card at the foot
of the form is where to record the frequency they were stated at — and the datasheet or paper they came from. The
note is for people: the solvers read the values themselves, never the note.

A material named **Air** is air, whatever it states: it is never meshed by a thermal run and fills an air box by default.
Renaming a material to or from *Air* changes its role, and the editor says so.

## Thermal properties {#thermal}

A thermal run needs a **thermal conductivity k** for every solid it meshes, and refuses one whose material states
neither k nor a k(T) table — the card says so while it is missing. **Density** and **specific heat** are what a thermal
impedance Z_th(jω) reads; a steady-state run does not need them.

Thermal conductivity usually falls as a material heats, and for a substrate under a hot device that matters. Open
**k(T) table** to state it point by point: **＋ Add point** adds 20 °C at the constant k on an empty table, then one
25 °C above the last point. Each point is a temperature and a value; the table keeps itself in order of temperature and
refuses two points at one temperature. Once stated, **the table wins over k**: a thermal run interpolates it linearly and
holds its end values beyond its range, and its notes say when it did. `check` warns when the table and k disagree at
20 °C by more than 1 %. **Clear table** removes it, and the run reads k again.

The Conductor card's **σ(T) table** works the same way for electrical conductivity. A thermal run's electrical half
(a bond wire's or a trace's resistive heating) reads it in place of σ₂₀ and α₂₀; every EM solver still reads σ₂₀, so
stating a table moves no EM answer. A **wBond** component's wires read the shipped metals' tables too, at the
component's `Temp` — held at the table's nearest end outside it, with a warning in the Messages panel.

## Anisotropic materials {#anisotropic}

A woven-glass laminate has a different permittivity in the plane of the board than through it, and a crystalline
substrate such as sapphire differs along its axes. Tick **Anisotropic εr** to state three values instead of one: **εr xx**,
**εr yy** and **εr zz**, along the 3D view's own x, y and z axes. Ticking it fills all three with εr, so start from there
and change the ones that differ. Unticking it removes the three values.

{{ui: materials-anisotropic}}

**Who reads which.** A **3D solver** reads the three values and not εr. The **planar solvers**, such as the [MoM engine](mom-engine.html), have no
direction, so they keep reading **εr**. Keep εr stated, at the value a planar solve
should use.

Thermal conductivity has the same choice on the Thermal card: tick **Anisotropic k** for **k xx**, **k yy** and **k zz**,
at 25 °C — a laminate conducts heat along its glass far better than through it. A thermal run's volume solve reads the
three values; anything with no direction (a bond wire, an effective block's mixing, `explain`) keeps reading k or the
k(T) table. With both stated, each direction follows the table's change from its 25 °C value. The axes are the view's,
fixed: **the tensor does not rotate with a rotated solid.**

## How it looks {#appearance}

The **Appearance** card decides how a material is drawn, in both 3D views, and no solver reads any of it. It holds two
colours because the two views have different jobs:

- **Base colour** and the fields with it set how it looks in the [realistic view](drawing-in-3d.html#realistic): how
  metallic, how rough, how see-through, and the rest of the glTF metallic-roughness set. A metal's base colour is its
  true reflectance — silver's is nearly white. A field it does not state shows, greyed, the value it takes from its role;
  **Like** borrows another material's whole look. The sphere is the material under the default studio, so a look can be
  judged with no 3D view open. Every field is described under [Appearance](drawing-in-3d.html#appearance), and
  [Changing how things look](drawing-in-3d.html#changing-look) says when to set a look on the material and when on one
  object.
- **Ordinary-view colour** sets the colour the ordinary 3D view draws every object of the material in. That view is a
  diagram, so by default it draws each conductor in its layer's colour (top and bottom metal stay apart) and each
  dielectric in the view's palette; leave the field empty for that.

{{ui: materials-appearance}}

Changing a colour or an appearance never makes a result out of date: two materials that differ only in how they look are
the same material to every solver.

## Renaming and deleting {#delete}

**Renaming** a material in its own file renames it everywhere it is used in files that are open — each file gets one
undo step of its own. A file that is not open is listed rather than rewritten; `check` then reports it as naming an unknown
material until you change it. The 3D view's dialog renames only a material it has just made, because renaming one that
other files already name is the file's own editor's job.

**Deleting**: select the material and press **Delete**, or right-click its row and choose **Delete Material**. If nothing
in the workspace uses it, it goes at once. If anything does, a `.cmat` lists every use first — stackup entries and bodies
in the technologies that name the library, objects in open 3D views, and `.c3d` and `.ctech` files that are not open —
and deletes only when you press **Delete Anyway**. Nothing that names it is rewritten, so `check` reports each of those
as an unknown material afterwards. The delete is one undo step, so it can be taken back until the file is saved.

The 3D view's **Materials dialog** deletes the same way, with two differences. A material you made in the dialog goes at
once, because no file names it yet. And, like every edit there, a delete reaches its file only when you press **OK**;
**Cancel** keeps the material. The dialog has its own **Undo** and **Redo** (the arrows beside OK, or Ctrl/⌘+Z and
Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z outside a text box), which take back any edit made in it, a delete included. After OK, the whole change is
one undo step in each file it went to. On a technology's Materials tab a material in use is not deleted at all; the uses are listed
instead. A library's row on that tab and a built-in material cannot be deleted from where they are shown — open the
library to delete one of its materials.

{{ui: materials-delete-menu}}

## In the file {#file}

A `.cmat` is JSON, and each material is one record in its `Materials` array — the same record a technology's own
`Materials` list holds. Every key but `Name` is optional, and a key left out is a value not stated:

```json
{
  "FormatVersion": 1,
  "Materials": [
    {
      "Name": "My laminate",
      "Epsr": 3.5,
      "EpsrTensor": [3.66, 3.66, 3.5],
      "TanD": 0.004,
      "ThermalK": 0.62,
      "ThermalKTensor": [0.8, 0.8, 0.62],
      "ThermalKVsTemp": [ { "TempC": 20, "Value": 0.62 }, { "TempC": 150, "Value": 0.57 } ],
      "DensityKgM3": 1900,
      "SpecificHeat": 900,
      "Source": "The supplier's datasheet, stated at 10 GHz.",
      "Appearance": { "BaseColor": "#C9B98A", "Roughness": 0.55 }
    }
  ]
}
```

A conductor states `Sigma20` (S/m) and `Alpha20` (1/K), and may state `SigmaVsTemp` in the same form as
`ThermalKVsTemp`; `Mur` is μr; `Color` is the ordinary-view colour. A technology names its libraries in its own
`MaterialLibraries` list: `"MaterialLibraries": [ "generic-materials.cmat" ]`. See
[File formats](file-formats.html) for every document type.
