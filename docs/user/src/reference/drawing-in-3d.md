The **3D editor** is where a cell's **3D view** is drawn: solids, sheets, bond wires and ports in three
dimensions, with the cells they are built from placed inside them. It is **part of circuitRF**. It is not
a front end to Palace or openEMS, and **it needs no solver installed**. Everything on this page up to
[Simulating](#simulate) — drawing, editing, placing cells, wires, ports, setups, `check`, `explain` and
section pictures — works on a machine with no 3D solver at all. A solver is needed for one thing: pressing
**Run**. When you do, circuitRF offers to install the one the setup names (see
[3D EM ▸ Getting the solvers](em-3d.html#getting)), and [EM Solvers](em-solvers.html) says which one suits
which problem.

This page teaches the editor through the **3D Package** example — an MMIC die in a ceramic package with a
lid — which was drawn with exactly the gestures below. Open it with **Tools ▸ Examples ▸ 3D Package**. The
**3D Connector** example teaches the operations the geometry kernel adds — booleans, fillets and STEP
parts — through a coaxial connector launching onto a board ([below](#connector)).

## The 3D view of a cell {#view}

A cell can have up to four views: a **schematic** (what it does), a **symbol** (how it is placed in a
schematic), a **layout** (its artwork, layer by layer) and a **3D view** (its solid model). The 3D view is
a file of its own, `<cell>/3d/<name>.c3d`, a small JSON document you can read and diff, and the Project
panel lists it under the cell like the others. **File ▸ New 3D Design…** makes a cell with an empty one,
**New 3D View** on a cell's menu in the Project panel adds one to an existing cell, and **New 3D View from Layout** makes one
holding the cell's own layout, ready to extend — the quickest way to take a layout you have already set up
for EM into 3D.

- **What it holds.** Boxes, prisms, cylinders, spheres, sheets, polyhedra and bond wires, each made of a named
  material; instances of other cells' layouts or 3D views; ports; boundaries on faces; VARs; and any number
  of EM setups. Everything a 3D solve needs is in the one file.
- **Units.** Every coordinate is stored as a whole number of **database units** (DBU; 1,000 per µm by
  default), exactly as a layout's are, so nothing drifts when you save and reopen. The **display unit** —
  the unit you read and type in — is chosen with the **Unit** box on the toolbar. It starts as the cell
  layout's unit, or the technology's. Changing it moves nothing. The example is drawn in **mil**; its die's
  layout is in **µm**. Both are exact.
- **Materials** come from the cell's technology. **Assign Material…**, **New Material…** and the **Edit…** button
  beside the Inspector's Material box open the **Materials** dialog: every material the technology has — its own and
  its libraries' (`.cmat` files, see [File formats](file-formats.html)) — with every property of the selected one on
  one form: dielectric, conductor, thermal, the σ(T) and k(T) tables, colour, appearance and notes. See, edit, **Duplicate** or
  make one there, then assign it. Edits go to the file each material belongs to when you press OK, as an unsaved
  change there — save that file to keep them; Cancel discards them. **Delete** (or right-click a material) removes one;
  a material already in use is listed with its uses first. A material that already exists is renamed in its own
  file's editor, which renames it everywhere it is used ([Materials](materials.html) walks
  through the editor and how a `.cmat` relates to a `.ctech`). A placed cell brings its **own**
  technology's materials with it — see [Hierarchy](#hierarchy).
- **Built-in materials.** The package button beside **Duplicate** lists the materials circuitRF ships with (metals,
  substrates, glass, die-attach and thermal materials) below the technology's own; each carries the package mark at
  the right of its row, and a material the technology already names is not listed twice. Assigning a built-in
  material, or editing any of its properties, copies it into the list shown under *New, duplicated and built-in
  materials go to* — usually the technology's own `.ctech` — where it is yours to change from then on, and the mark
  goes. A built-in material keeps its name; **Duplicate** it to make a copy under another. The technology editor's
  Materials tab has the same button.
- **Edit Material…** opens the file a material is defined in, on its row. Right-click a material's heading in the
  Objects tree (by material; *No material* has none), or an object's row, which says which material:
  *Edit Material 'FR4'…*. A material in the technology's own list opens the technology on its **Materials** tab; one
  from a `.cmat` library opens that library. A library shipped inside circuitRF is not a file you can edit, so its
  material opens on the technology's Materials tab, where it can be read. A placed cell's part edits its own
  technology's material, and the item names that file: *Edit Material 'Au' (in pa.ctech)…*. An editor that is already
  open — in another tab, floated, or in another workspace window — is brought forward rather than opened again, and
  the list scrolls to the row. With no technology, the item is greyed; give the design one with *3D ▸ Materials…*.
- **Hovering** an object names it and shows the material properties that apply to what it is to the solver: a
  conductor, a wire, a via or a sheet shows σ at the operating temperature (and μr when it is not 1), never εr or tanδ;
  a dielectric shows εr (or its three tensor values) and tanδ, and σ only when it is above 0 — a doped substrate's
  loss; air says *Air*. What the object is follows its **Role** when you gave it one, as the solve does. An object with
  no material says so, and a material that states nothing says that. With a thermal setup active, every solid also
  shows k, and ρ and c when the setup computes a Z_th or a pulse.
- **The editor and the viewer are one pane.** The 3D view a solver result opens in, **Show 3D** on a setup,
  and this editor share the camera, the clip plane, the mesh and field displays, and every key described in
  [3D EM ▸ The 3D view](em-3d.html#view). The editor adds the drawing.

The camera is the viewer's: drag to orbit; right-, middle-, Alt- or Shift-drag to pan; scroll to zoom;
**Home** fits; **1** is isometric, **2**–**7** the six orthographic views, **P** toggles perspective, **L** the [realistic view](#realistic); **C**
turns on the clip plane. A new 3D view opens orthographic. The line along the bottom of the view is the
**status line**: what the armed tool wants next, or what the last edit did, or why it was refused.

## The example: an MMIC in a package {#example}

**Tools ▸ Examples ▸ 3D Package** copies a workspace with two cells to a folder you choose, and opens its
`README.md`, which carries the numbers quoted here.

- **Thru die** — an MMIC's **layout**, drawn in **µm** on a GaAs technology (`tech/mmic-gaas.ctech`: 100 µm
  of GaAs, two gold metals, a gold back side). A 1000 × 600 µm die with a 75 µm line between two 100 µm pads.
- **Package** — a **3D view**, drawn in **mil** on a ceramic-package technology
  (`tech/ceramic-package.ctech`: alumina, gold and a lid alloy). A gold floor; 5 mil of alumina on it; a
  gold die-attach pad on four gold vias; two 5 mil gold leads; the **Thru die** layout placed on the attach
  pad as instance **U1**; a ball–wedge gold wire from each die pad to its lead; a port at each lead's outer
  end; four gold walls; and a lid.

{{ui: em3d-package-3d-open}}

{{ui: em3d-package-3d-closed}}

{{ui: em3d-package-3d-section}}

The cavity is **400 × 320 mil and 40 mil high** — three **cell parameters**, `cav_w`, `cav_l` and `cav_h`,
that the floor, the base, the walls and the lid are all written in terms of, so changing one redraws the
package (see [Dimensions as expressions](#expressions)). The die, its pad, the leads, the wires and the
ports do not depend on them: a bigger cavity leaves the die where it is and moves the walls out.

## The second example: a connector launch {#connector}

**Tools ▸ Examples ▸ 3D Connector** is a coaxial connector launching onto a 50 Ω microstrip at a board's edge —
the 3D problem an RF board meets most — and it is built from the operations the geometry kernel adds:

- **Board** — a layout in **mil**: 20 mil of PTFE-glass laminate over a ground plane, with a 62 mil line.
- **Flange** — a 3D view in **mm**: a plate with a hole, a **Subtract** of a cylinder from a box. It is the source
  of the STEP file below, standing in for the model a connector's maker would send.
- **Launch** — a 3D view in **mm**: the board placed from its layout; a housing with its **bore subtracted and
  kept** as the PTFE fill (*Keep tools*); the flange **imported from STEP** (`flange.step`, exported from Flange)
  and **united** with the housing; a centre pin whose tip is **filleted** — a fillet on a curved edge; and two
  ports and two setups, one for **Palace** and one for **openEMS**.

{{ui: em3d-connector-3d}}

{{ui: em3d-connector-section}}

Its `README.md` lists the gestures that drew it, in order — Box, Cylinder, *Boolean ▸ Subtract…* with the Tool
selected first and *Keep tools* ticked, *Export STEP…* and *Import STEP…*, *Boolean ▸ Unite…*, **E** and
*Fillet…* — and what each run measured. The experiment it exists for is one click: untick **Enabled** on the pin's
fillet row in the object tree and Simulate again. Palace meshes the fillet as a curved surface; openEMS, whose grid
cell at the tip is wider than the fillet's radius, says before the run that it will not represent it. What each
makes of it is in [EM Solvers ▸ What each solver sees of curved geometry](em-solvers.html#curved).

## Selecting {#selecting}

**O**, **F**, **E** and **V** choose what a click selects — a whole **object**, one **face**, one **edge**, or
one **vertex** — and the toolbar has a button for each. What is under the cursor is highlighted; a click selects
it, **Shift**-click adds or removes, **Esc** clears.

- **Edge mode** (**E**) picks the edge nearest the cursor that you can see. An edge is a whole run between two
  faces — a cylinder's rim is one edge, not a ring of segments — named by those two faces: `xmax|zmax`,
  `bottom|side`, `bore:side|zmax`. Where one pair of faces meets in more than one place the name takes a number,
  `side|zmax|1`, `side|zmax|2`, counted in the object's own frame, so moving or turning it renames nothing.
  **Double-click** an edge to take its **tangent chain** — every edge that carries on smoothly from it (within a
  degree), the loop round a rounded top — and **Shift**-double-click to add it; a chain that meets a fork stops
  there and says how many ways it could go. Properties shows an edge's faces, kind and length, and a circle's or
  an arc's radius and centre; several edges, their count and total length. Edge mode needs no geometry kernel.

- **B** selects the next thing **behind** the selection along the line of sight through the cursor, and
  **Shift+B** steps back toward you; the status line says where you are (`Face zmin · "base" · 2 of 5`).
  In the example: select the lid in Object mode, press **B**, and the selection passes through the lid to
  the wire, the die and the floor in turn — the way to reach something inside a closed package without
  hiding anything. A face's **boundary** — the blue or green tint of a thermal one, the tint of an EM one — is what a
  click on it selects (its row, and its fields in Properties); **B** from it steps to the solid, or in Face mode the
  face, under it.
- **Right-click** opens the menu for what is selected: *Hide*, *Isolate*, *Show All*, *Select Owning
  Object*, and the commands this page describes. **Hide** the lid and the walls to work inside the package;
  **Show All** brings them back. Hiding changes only the picture — the solver still sees everything.
- **H** hides the selection, and shows it again: press it in the view or in the object tree (where a selection of
  several rows is usually made), or use *3D ▸ Hide / Show Selection*, the same item on either right-click menu, or the
  eye button on the toolbar just left of the mesh button. When all of the selection is shown, H hides it; when all of it
  is hidden, H shows it; when **some** of it is hidden, H shows all of it first, and the next H hides all of it. The
  selection stays selected while hidden, so a second H brings back exactly what the first took away. A group selected
  whole counts as its members, and records count as well as objects (a probe, a mesh region, a thermal boundary, a
  symmetry plane, a field plot), each hidden as its own tick hides it. An object's hide is one undo step and is saved;
  an instance's parts are hidden in the view only. The eye button's **background** shows the state: the accent colour
  when all of the selection is shown, the same colour dimmed when some of it is hidden, and none when all of it is hidden;
  with nothing selected the button is greyed. Its tooltip says what a press will do. It is in a setup's 3D view too,
  where hiding lasts for the session, as that view's ticks do.
- The **Objects** tree lists everything by material or by type — and your [groups](#groups) first; a click there selects in the view, and the
  **Properties** panel shows the selection's name, material, dimensions and position, every one of them
  editable. The eye buttons in its header **hide or show every row it lists**, records included — heat sources,
  probes, mesh regions, effective blocks, symmetry planes, thermal boundaries and field plots — as one undo step. An
  object's tick is saved with the document; a record's tick (a place, a boundary, a plane) is this view's alone.

## Snapping {#snapping}

The cursor snaps to a **vertex** (a square marker), an edge's **midpoint** (a triangle), the nearest point on
an **edge** (an ×), a face's **centre** (a circle), and otherwise to the **grid** (a small +) on the
drawing plane. A vertex wins over anything else within reach. Snapping reaches **into placed cells**: the
corner of a pad on the die, inside U1, is a target in the package. Only what you can see is a target,
except through a translucent object or with the clip plane on.

The magnet button turns snapping off and on, and the buttons beside it turn each kind on and off; these are
your settings, not the document's. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on a Mac) to suspend geometry snapping while
drawing; the grid still applies. The **Snap** box beside **Unit** sets the grid step (the example uses
0.5 mil); changing it moves nothing already drawn. A **≈** before a coordinate means the point is not
exactly on the database-unit grid (a corner of something rotated by an odd angle).

## Drawing {#drawing}

**The drawing plane.** Shapes are drawn on a plane — **XY**, **YZ** or **XZ** at an offset along its
normal — chosen from the toolbar's plane box and offset field (a bare number is the display unit; `25um`
or `10mil` says its own), from *3D ▸ Drawing Plane*, or from geometry: with a tool armed, **Ctrl**-click
(**Cmd**-click on a Mac) a face to draw on it, or **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift**-click a snapped point to move the
offset there. A faint grid lies on the plane; moving the camera never moves it.

**The tools** are on the toolbar, under *3D ▸ Draw*, and at the cursor: press **Shift+A**, then one letter.

| Letter | Tool | Clicks |
|---|---|---|
| **B** | Box | a corner, the opposite corner, then the height |
| **S** | Sheet | two corners (a conducting rectangle with a thickness) |
| **G** | Polygon | a click per vertex; click the first, press Enter or double-click to close |
| **L** | Polyline | construction lines, never solved; Enter or a double-click ends one |
| **Y** | Cylinder | the centre, the radius, then the height |
| **E** | Sphere | the centre, then the radius; it is centred on the drawing plane |
| **P** | Port | two corners on the plane (see [Simulating](#simulate)) |
| **W** | Wire | two pads, then the loop height (see [Bond wires](#wires)) |
| **H** | Heat source | two corners on the plane, then its name and power (see [Temperature](#thermal)) |
| **T** | Probe | a click on a face: the temperature there (see [Temperature](#thermal)) |
| **M** | Mesh region | a box, then the element size inside it (see [Temperature](#thermal)) |

**Typing instead of clicking.** While a shape is in progress, type a digit and a box opens at the cursor
showing what the next click would set — width and depth, then height (or radius, then height). **Tab**
moves between the fields, **Enter** accepts, **Esc** goes back to the mouse. A value can carry its own unit
(`127um` while drawing in mil) and can be an expression (see [Dimensions as expressions](#expressions)).
Each new object takes the toolbar's material and a name you can change (`box1`, `cyl1`, …), and each is one
undo step. **Esc** cancels a shape; pressed again it puts the tool down.

**How the example's package was drawn.** With the material box on *Gold* and the XY plane at 0, **Shift+A
B**, one click anywhere, then typed: `cav_w + 2*wall` **Tab** `cav_l + 2*wall` **Enter**, `floor_t`
**Enter**. That is the floor's size; its corner was typed in Properties (`-cav_w/2 - wall`,
`-cav_l/2 - wall`, `-floor_t`), and its name (`floor`) there too. The alumina base, the attach pad, the
leads, the walls and the lid are drawn the same way. The four vias are one **cylinder** (radius `2`, height
`5`) and *Array…* (right-click): 2 × 2 at 36 × 20 mil. The walls and the lid were drawn **last**: drawn
first, they would hide the inside while you work on it.

**Extrude** (a sheet's menu, *3D ▸ Modify*, or a polyline selected in the tree) pulls a closed polyline, a
polygon or a rectangle into a prism: move to set the distance and click, or type it. **K** keeps the
source.

## Moving and editing {#editing}

**Whole objects** (Object mode; right-click, or *3D ▸ Modify*). *3D ▸ Modify* is greyed out until something is
selected, and each item in it is enabled only when it can act on the selection — the same rule the right-click menu
follows, where a greyed-out item's tooltip says why:

- **G** moves the selection: click a base point, then a target point, both snapped — two clicks put one
  corner exactly on another. **X**, **Y** or **Z** holds the move to that axis, **Shift+X/Y/Z** to the plane
  across it; type a digit for the distance.
- **R** rotates about the drawing plane's normal in 15° steps (**Shift** for free, or type the angle);
  *Rotate 90°* and *Mirror* act at once. A rotated box is still a box.
- **Ctrl+D** (**Cmd+D**) duplicates and moves the copies; *Array…* makes copies along up to three axes at a
  pitch, previewed as you type; *Align* lines objects up on an axis.
- The **gizmo** at the selection's centre: drag an arrow to move along it, a square to move in its plane.
- *Order*: where two solids overlap, the later one in the list wins the shared volume — except that **metal
  always wins over a dielectric**, whatever the order. That is why the example's vias can simply be drawn
  through the alumina base: they are gold, so they win.

**Faces and vertices** (Face mode, **F**; Vertex mode, **V**):

- **N** (*Move Along Normal*) pushes or pulls a face. Its neighbours keep their planes and stretch to meet
  it, so a pushed box is still a box. It stops before a neighbour would vanish, and says which.
- **G** moves a face freely (its neighbours tilt to follow), or a vertex in Vertex mode; Properties' *Set
  coordinates* types where a vertex goes.
- **Shift+E** grows a new solid out of a face along its normal — a bump on a pad, a wall on a floor. *Align to
  Face…* moves an object until two faces meet (**T** switches between *Touching* and *Flush*). *Copy as
  Sheet* makes a sheet on a face. *Measure* reports a face's area, perimeter and normal.

**Why a solid never opens.** Every edit keeps a solid **closed**. No face is ever deleted, so there is no
Delete in Face mode, and a face that can no longer be flat is split into flat triangles named after it
(`top.0`, `top.1`). An edit that would make a solid pass through itself is drawn in red and refused, naming
the faces. A closed solid is what a mesher needs; an open one would be a hole in the problem that nothing
reported. A shape keeps its kind as long as its own dimensions can say the result — otherwise it becomes a
**polyhedron** with the same face names, and the status line says so.

**Measure** (**M**): two snapped clicks give both points, their differences and the distance, in the display
unit; every number copies, and pastes back into a dimension box exactly.

### Groups {#groups}

A **group** gathers objects and placed cells under one name, so the whole of a part — a stage, a lid and its
walls, a row of pads — is picked, moved and changed as one thing.

- **Group Objects** (**Ctrl+G**, **Cmd+G** on a Mac; the right-click menu, in the view or the tree; *3D ▸ Modify*)
  makes one group of the selection, named `Group1`, `Group2` and so on. Select the members first — two or more
  objects, instances or groups — in the view or with **Shift**/**Ctrl**-click in the tree; with one thing selected
  (a single object, or a group on its own) it is greyed out, and its tooltip says why. Placed cells can be members too, and so can other groups: a group
  inside a group stays a group of its own.
- **A click in the view on any member selects the whole group** — the outermost one it is in — and every
  Object-mode command acts on all of it: Move, Rotate, Mirror, Duplicate, Array, Align (which lines the group up by
  its own box and moves it as one), Order, Hide, Isolate, Delete, a material, and a boolean — whose panel lists
  every member, so the Blank is chosen there as usual; the result stays in its Blank's group. To pick one member out
  of a group, click its row in the tree, or press **B** in the view.
- **In the object tree** groups are listed first, under **Groups**; open one to see the groups and then the objects
  and instances inside it. A member is listed there and nowhere else. The tick beside a group shows or hides all of it.
- **Properties** shows a group as one thing: its **Name** (rename it there), one **Material** and one **Role** for
  every member — the box reads **Various** while they differ, and a choice applies to all of them — and its
  **Corner**: type one and every member moves by the same step. The **Size** is the members' box, for reading; a
  group has no placement or size of its own, and each member keeps its own.
- **Ungroup** (**Ctrl+Shift+G**, **Cmd+Shift+G**; *Ungroup Group1* on the right-click menu) takes apart only the
  outermost group: the groups that were inside it stay groups, to be ungrouped in turn if you want.
- **Duplicate** or **Array** a whole group and each copy is a new group (`Group2`, and each group inside it
  renamed the same way); a member copied on its own stays in its group.
- Grouping, ungrouping and renaming are each **one undo step**, and the groups are saved in the `.c3d`: each member
  names its group — `"Group": "stage1/match"` — so a group can never be left empty or point at nothing.
  **Flatten** puts a placed cell's contents in that instance's group, and **Group into Cell** gives the new instance
  the group its contents were in. Groups are only organisation: the solver never sees them.
- A group's **Transparency** is one row too — see [Transparency](#transparency) — and so is its **Model** — see
  [Model](#model).

### Transparency {#transparency}

How see-through an object is drawn belongs to the **object**, not to its material: a lid can be made see-through to
show the die under it without changing the lid's alloy, which every other object made of it shares and which belongs
to the technology.

- **Properties** has a **Transparency** row on every object that is drawn filled (a polyline is a line, and has none),
  on a boolean, fillet or chamfer (for its result — the objects inside it have none of their own), and on a placed cell.
  Drag the **slider** and the view shows each position as you drag; the value is kept when you let go, as **one undo
  step**. Or type a whole number in the box — **0** is opaque, and the most is **95 %**. **Default** clears it.
- **With no value of its own** an object is drawn as its kind is: a dielectric translucent, a conductor opaque, air
  faint. The box shows that default greyed — *65 (default)* for a dielectric — so you can see where you start from.
  Setting a value replaces it, so a **conductor can be made see-through** too, and a dielectric made solid with 0.
- **A group** selected whole shows one row. When its members agree it shows their value; when they differ it reads
  **mixed**. Setting it writes that value to **every member at every depth**, nested groups included, as one undo
  step — until then each member keeps its own. A **selection of several objects** gets the same one row.
- **A placed cell's** value multiplies onto each of its parts' own: a cell placed at 50 % whose part is drawn at 50 %
  shows that part at 75 %. Click any part of the instance to edit it.
- It is saved in the `.c3d` only when set — `"Transparency": 60` — so a document that never sets one is unchanged. It
  is drawing only: the solver never reads it, and changing it does not make a result stale.
- A see-through object is still picked by its surfaces, like any other. While a pushed-in cell's surroundings or a
  boolean's operands are drawn dimmed or ghosted, those looks win.

### Appearance {#appearance}

An **appearance** says how an object looks in the [realistic view](#realistic): how metallic, how rough, how see-through. It belongs
first to the **material** — forty copper objects should not need forty edits — and an **object** or a placed cell may
override it, because plating is usually not modelled: a copper trace that should look gold-plated is the common case.
A boolean's operand — its Blank, or a Tool, kept or not — has no appearance of its own: it looks like its material, unless the
top-level operation states one, which styles everything that operation makes. The Inspector says so when one is selected.

The keys are glTF 2.0's metallic-roughness set, and every one is optional:

| Key | Range | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseColor` | `#rrggbb` | a metal's reflectance, a dielectric's body colour |
| `Metallic` | 0–1 | 1 for a metal, 0 for a dielectric |
| `Roughness` | 0–1 | 0 a mirror, 1 matte |
| `Transmission` | 0–1 | see-through: glass, quartz, a thin laminate |
| `Ior` | 1.0–3.0 | the **optical** index of refraction |
| `Clearcoat`, `ClearcoatRoughness` | 0–1 | a glossy layer over the body, such as solder mask |
| `AttenuationColor` | `#rrggbb` | the tint light picks up passing through |
| `AttenuationDistance` | metres, above 0 | how far it travels before taking that tint |
| `Like` | a material's name | that material's look first, with these fields over it |

- **On a material** (a `.cmat` or a technology's own list) it is one more key on the record:
  `"Appearance": { "BaseColor": "#FAD1C2", "Metallic": 1, "Roughness": 0.35 }`. The shipped generic library states true
  reflectances for its metals and visual values for its dielectrics. A metal's display **Color** is unchanged, so the
  ordinary view's copper still looks like the diagrammatic copper you know.
- **On an object or a placed cell** in the `.c3d` it overrides the material's **field by field**. The plated trace is
  `"Appearance": { "Like": "Gold" }` on a copper object; `{ "Roughness": 0.1 }` is polished copper. A placed cell's
  appearance applies to every part inside it, and a part's own field wins; of nested cells, the innermost wins. A
  boolean, fillet or chamfer carries it for its result.
- **What is not stated** comes from the next statement down: the object, each placed cell around it, the material (and
  its `Like`), then for `BaseColor` the material's display **Color**, then the role's default — a conductor metallic
  and fairly rough, a via and a bond wire a little smoother, a dielectric not metallic.
- **Nothing physical is read from it, or into it.** The optical index is not worked out from εr (alumina's εr would give
  3.1; its optical index is about 1.76). No solver reads an appearance, two materials that differ only in appearance
  (or colour) are the same material, and **editing an appearance never makes a result stale** — in the `.c3d`, or in a
  material library or technology a run read.
- `check` refuses a value out of its range and a `Like` cycle, and warns about a `Like` naming no material, whose look
  then falls through. `circuitrf explain view.c3d --object U1/trace` prints the look one object resolves to, and which
  statement decided each field.

### Model: kept in the drawing, left out of the solve {#model}

To try a run without the lid, a second row of bond wires or a fixture, untick its **Model**: it stays on screen, where
you can still select, move and edit it, and it is left out of **every** simulation run — EM and thermal alike — until
you tick it again. Hiding an object is not the same thing: a hidden object is still solved.

- **Properties** has a **Model** check box on every object that can be solved: a box, prism, cylinder, sphere, sheet, polygon,
  wire, a boolean, fillet or chamfer (for its result — the objects inside it have none of their own), a placed cell
  (every part of it), a **port** and a **heat source**. A polyline is construction geometry and is never solved
  anyway. An effective block's switch is its own **Enabled**, which the Properties row calls **Model** too.
- **A group** selected whole, or several objects selected, shows one box — ticked, unticked, or half-ticked where the
  members differ. Clicking it writes **every member at every depth** as **one undo step**.
- Right-click an object, a group, a port or a heat source (in the view or in the tree) for the same **Model** item,
  with a ✓ while it is modelled.
- **The tree greys it.** By material, it stays under its material with its name greyed; by type it is listed under
  **Not Modeled** (after the type groups, before Instances), its type in the row's detail. A member of a group stays in
  its group's row, greyed — and a group whose every member is off has a greyed name. A port that is off is greyed in
  **Ports** (by type, under Not Modeled too). The tree's filter has **Not Modeled** as a type, to show or hide them all.
- **The view draws it as it is**; its tooltip ends *(not modelled)*.
- **Anything that refers to it is refused, naming both** — a port that is modelled whose conductor is not, a wire whose
  pad is not, a heat source or a probe on it, a face boundary on it — so a result can never be solved without
  something you did not know was missing. Turn the other one off too, or put it back. A field plot on it just shows
  nothing, and **check** warns.
- **A port that is off is absent**: no excitation, no port sheet, no lumped element — the gap it spanned is open, not
  terminated in its Z0. The result's ports are the ones left, **numbered 1…N in their order**: with P2 off, P1, P3 and
  P4 are the result's ports 1, 2 and 3. The run's notes say so, and so does the `.sNp` file's header, one line per
  port; the document's own port numbers never change, so ticking P2 again gives the four-port result back. A schematic
  placing that `.sNp` sees the new pin count, and the run's notes say that too.
- It is saved in the `.c3d` only when unticked — `"Model": false` — so a document that never unticks one is
  unchanged. Unlike Transparency it **is** part of the solved model: toggling it makes the last result stale. Editing
  or moving an object while it is not modelled does not, since no run has it.
- A not-modelled object is still **exported** — to STEP and by Export Drawing — because those export what is drawn.
- `circuitrf check` lists what is not modelled and reports the refusals above; `explain` names it in its walk.

### Copy and Paste between 3D views {#copy-paste}

Objects copy out of one 3D view and paste into another — in this workspace, another workspace, or another running
circuitRF — or back into the same one. It is the object tree's gesture:

- **Copy**: right-click a row, a group or several selected rows in the object tree, or press **Ctrl/Cmd+C** there. In
  the view, right-click ▸ **Copy Objects** copies the selection's rows; the view's own **Copy** stays the picture.
- **Paste**: right-click any row, or the tree's empty area, or press **Ctrl/Cmd+V** in the tree. It is greyed, with
  *Nothing copied from a 3D view*, until a 3D copy is on the clipboard.
- **What copies**: objects whole (material, role, group, placement, visibility, transparency, **Model**, every expression,
  a boolean's operands and a fillet's edges); a group with all its members; placed cells; ports; EM face boundaries,
  thermal boundaries (from the active setup) and symmetry planes; heat sources, probes, mesh regions and effective blocks
  when their rows are selected. **Field plots** and the **air box** do not copy: a plot is a reading of a run, and the
  air box is the setup's.
- **Where it lands**: exactly where it was copied from, at the target's resolution — nothing is offset, so a paste into
  the same view sits on its original. The pasted rows are selected, ready to move (**G**). The whole paste is **one undo
  step**.
- **Names**: a name the target already uses takes the first free `_2`, `_3`…, and every reference inside the paste
  follows — a boolean's tools, a heat source's solid, a probe's face, a port's conductors, a boundary's face, and group
  paths. A pasted group `pa` next to an existing `pa` becomes a new group `pa_2`, never merged into it. The status line
  lists every rename.
- **Variables**: the expressions come through, and so do the variables they name (and the ones those name). A name the
  target lacks is **created**. A name it has, defined identically, is **reused** silently. A name it has, defined
  differently, is asked in the **Paste** dialog, both definitions side by side: **Reuse** the one already here (the
  pasted dimensions then evaluate to this view's value), or **Rename** the pasted one — every pasted expression that named
  it follows. A reuse that would make two names depend on each other is refused, naming the cycle; rename instead. A
  cell parameter of the copied view arrives as a plain VAR, and the report says so.
- **Materials**: looked up in this view's technology as a run looks them up. **Found**: used — this workspace's
  definition wins, and a difference in value is reported. **Missing**: the Paste dialog lists it with its values,
  ticked, and says where it would go (the technology's own materials, or its writable library). **Paste** creates the
  ticked ones with every property they had, leaving that technology or library unsaved; **Paste Without Creating** (or
  unticking one) pastes the objects with **no material**, where they wait under *No material* until one is given. Undo
  removes the pasted objects but not a created material, which is an edit of the other document.
- **Placed cells** keep pointing at the cell they placed, even from another workspace (the reference may then leave this
  workspace, as a layout paste's may). A cell that no longer exists pastes as a broken reference, and the report names it.
- **Ports** keep their numbers where free; otherwise they take the next free ones, in order, and the report gives the
  mapping (*P1→P3*). A port's conductors follow the copied objects; a conductor not copied binds to this view's object of
  that name (the report says so), else both are cleared and inferred from what the port touches.
- **Boundaries**: one on a face this view lacks is left out and reported. A thermal boundary goes into the **active
  thermal setup** — with none active it is left out, and the report names the thermal setups to make active. A face
  that already carries a boundary asks **Keep this document's** (the default) or **Replace**; so does a symmetry plane on
  an axis this view already declares elsewhere. A pasted plane that does not lie on the model's extent still pastes, and
  the report says a run will refuse it until it does.
- **Cancel** in the Paste dialog pastes nothing and creates nothing.

## Reference images {#images}

A photo or a drawing can be put into the 3D view to **trace** — a die photo, a package outline from a datasheet, a
fixture drawing — or to lay the design over and compare. It goes in two ways: as a **sheet** on the drawing plane, or
**mapped onto a face** of an object.

### An image sheet {#image-sheet}

- **Placing one**: the **Insert Image…** button on the toolbar (beside the sheet tools), *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Image…*, or drag
  an image file onto the view. PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF and WebP are read; any other file dropped on the view is refused and
  nothing is placed. The image lands on the **current drawing plane**, centred where the view's centre — or the drop
  point — meets the plane, its long edge about **a quarter of the view's width** there, its pixels' aspect kept. Several
  files dropped at once are laid side by side. Each placement is **one undo step**, and the new sheet is selected.
- **It is a sheet.** Everything a sheet does it does: move, rotate, group, copy, array, hide, a material, a port from
  its row. It is placed **not modelled** and with **no material**, so it is drawn and left out of every run; tick
  **Model** to put the sheet in the solve (the picture never is — it is only how the sheet is drawn). By type the tree
  lists it under **Not Modeled**, with an image icon and the file's name; the tree's filter has **Image sheets** to hide
  every one in a click.
- **Tracing.** Right-click it ▸ **Drawing Plane from Image** puts the drawing plane on the image's own plane; then pick
  the Polygon tool and trace. Whatever is drawn on that plane is drawn **over** the image and is what a click picks:
  an image gives way to the faces lying on it.
- **In front of faces.** To show a picture *on* a solid — a sheet lying exactly on one of its faces — tick **In front
  of faces** in Properties, or pick **Image in Front of Faces** from its menu. The image is then drawn over every face
  on its plane and is what a click there picks. Untick it (**Image Behind Faces**) to make it a tracing underlay again.
  To put a picture on one face of an object without a separate sheet, use a face image (below).
- **Which way up.** On an XY plane the image's right is +x and its up +y; on XZ right +x, up +z; on YZ right +y, up +z —
  as the Top, Front and Right views show them, never mirrored. The sheet's own rotation and mirror move it with the sheet.
- **Properties ▸ Image**: the file (**Browse…** points it at another, **Reveal** shows it), its pixels, **Width** and
  **Height** with **Keep aspect**, **Reset to Image Aspect**, **Locked**, **In front of faces** and **Remove Image** (the sheet stays, an
  ordinary sheet — a traced reference becomes a real one). Its **Transparency** row is the image's; a PNG's own
  transparency is kept too.
- **Locked** keeps a tracing underlay where it is: it is still selected and edited in Properties, but Move, Rotate, the
  quarter turns, Mirror, the gizmo and a vertex move are refused with a sentence on the status line. Lock and unlock it
  from its menu or from Properties.
- **Resizing on the canvas**: in Vertex mode, moving a corner resizes the image from the opposite corner, keeping its
  aspect — hold **Shift** to let the aspect go. It stays a rectangle.
- **Its menu** also has **Replace Image…**, **Resolve Path…** (when the file cannot be found — the sheet then shows a
  checker with a red cross, and its row a warning) and **Refresh Image**, which reads the file again after you edit it
  elsewhere.
- **Where the file is.** The `.c3d` keeps a **reference**, never the picture: relative to the `.c3d` when the file is
  inside the workspace, absolute when it is outside. Keep reference images inside the workspace so an archive carries
  them (one outside is offered as an outside file) and so revision history keeps them; an image outside the workspace is
  not versioned. Copy and paste into another view, Save As, Flatten and Group into Cell all keep the reference resolving.
- **Very large images** are drawn at up to 4096 pixels on their long edge; a Messages note says when one was reduced.
- **Drawing only.** No solver, mesher or STEP export reads a picture. Changing an image never makes a result stale.
  STEP export leaves out an image sheet that is not modelled, with one note. Extruding an image sheet makes a solid with
  no image. *Copy Picture*, *Export Picture…*, *Copy as Vector* and *Export Drawing…* draw the images as the view does.

### An image on a face {#face-image}

- **Mapping one**: in Face mode, right-click a **flat** face ▸ **Map Image…**, or hold **Shift** while dropping an image
  file onto a face. It is fitted — as large as fits in the face, centred, its aspect kept. A face carries one image; mapping
  onto a face that has one **replaces** it, as one undo step. A curved face (a cylinder's side or a sphere's surface) and a placed cell's face
  refuse it, saying why — open the cell to map onto its own faces.
- **Which way up**: seen from outside the solid, up is +z (on a top or bottom face, +y), so the picture is never mirrored.
- **It belongs to its object**: rename, duplicate, array, group, copy and paste carry it, and deleting the object takes it
  with it. It is listed **beneath its object** in the tree — *Image on zmax*, with the file's name — and its tick hides
  it (saved, one undo step; **H** and Hide all reach it too).
- **Selecting it**: click it in the view (**B** steps to the face beneath), or its row; selecting the face in Face mode
  shows it below the face's readout. **Properties** has its file, pixels, its **own Transparency** — a lid at 80 % can
  carry a marking at 0 % — **Rotation** (with ⟲ 90° and ⟳ 90°), **Width**/**Height** with Keep aspect (clear one and it
  follows the other; clear both and the image is fitted again), **Offset** (right, up), **Fit to Face**, **Hidden** and
  **Remove Image**.
- **Removing it**: **Remove Image** on the face's menu, in Properties, or on its own menu (in the view or the tree), or
  **Delete** with it selected — one undo step each.
- **It is drawn only where the face is**: an image larger than its face is cropped by it, and a smaller one leaves the
  face's own colour round it. A face that no longer exists after an edit keeps its image in the file, not drawn; its row
  warns, `check` names it, and Remove takes it away.

## Dimensions as expressions {#expressions}

Wherever a dimension is typed — the box at the cursor, Properties, the Array panel — you may type a name or
an expression: `cav_w`, `2*wall`, `cav_l/2 + wall`. Names are **VARs** of the 3D view or the cell's
**parameters**, and the **Variables** panel (the *x* button) lists both. An unknown name opens a **Define**
strip under the box, so a name can be made on the spot.

The example's names:

| Name | Value | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `cav_w`, `cav_l`, `cav_h` | 400, 320, 40 mil | **cell parameters** of *Package* — each a VAR promoted with *Promote to Cell Parameter* |
| `wall` | 20 mil | a VAR: the wall thickness |
| `floor_t` | 2 mil | a VAR: the floor's thickness |
| `lid_t` | 5 mil | a VAR: the lid's thickness |

**Changing one redraws everything that uses it**: set `cav_w` to `480` in the Variables panel and the
floor, the base, the east and west walls and the lid all move; the die and the leads stay where they are.
Dragging a face whose size is an expression (**N**) writes the **name**, not the field, so every other
object using that name follows too.

<div class="callout">
<span class="label">Units in an expression</span>
<p>A number may carry its own unit, written straight after it with no space: <code>cav_w + 40mil</code>,
<code>10um + 1mil</code>, <code>2*wall + 0.5mm</code>. A number with no unit that is <b>added to</b>, subtracted from
or compared with a name that has a unit takes the <b>box's</b> unit: <code>cav_w + 40</code> typed in mil is
<code>cav_w</code> plus forty mil. A number that <b>multiplies</b> or divides stays a plain number:
<code>2*wall</code> is twice the wall.</p>
<p>A lone <code>m</code> is <b>milli</b>, not the metre, exactly as in a netlist: <code>2m</code> is 2 mm. Write
<code>mm</code> to say so, or <code>metre</code> for metres; the box refuses a bare <code>2m</code> and
<code>check</code> warns about an <code>m</code> inside a length. <code>check</code> also warns about any dimension
over 1 m, the mark a unit slip leaves.</p>
<p>A VAR follows the same rule: its unit scales its expression only when the expression names nothing with a unit of
its own. <code>w2 = 2*w</code> in mil, with <code>w</code> = 10 mil, is 20 mil, and <code>w3 = w + 5</code> in mil is
15 mil. A VAR written <code>w = 10mil</code> needs no unit of its own.</p>
</div>

## Booleans, fillets, chamfers and STEP parts {#operations}

Four kinds of object are built by **OpenCASCADE**, the geometry kernel that ships inside circuitRF, rather
than by the editor itself: a **Boolean** (subtract, unite or intersect), a **Fillet**, a **Chamfer** and a
**Step** part (one solid of an imported STEP file). **Settings ▸ Solvers** says whether this installation has
the kernel. **All four are made in the editor** — booleans and fillets below, STEP parts in
[STEP](#step) — and a `.c3d` holding any of them is drawn, checked, explained and elaborated. The kernel is
Open CASCADE Technology; **Help ▸ About** and its third-party notices say which version and under what
licence.

A boolean owns its operands. This one subtracts a bore from a lid:

```json
{
	"$type": "Boolean",
	"Name": "lid",
	"Op": "Subtract",
	"Blank": {
		"$type": "Box",
		"Material": "Lid alloy",
		"Min": [0, 0, 500000],
		"Size": [4000000, 3000000, 250000]
	},
	"Tools": [
		{
			"$type": "Cylinder",
			"Name": "bore",
			"Base": [2000000, 1500000, 400000],
			"Axis": "Z",
			"Length": 500000,
			"Radius": 300000
		}
	]
}
```

- **The boolean takes its Blank's name.** The box inside it has no `Name`, and the result is `lid` — so a
  port or a boundary that was on `lid` before anything was subtracted from it is still on `lid`. A Fillet or
  Chamfer takes its Target's name the same way. The result's **material and role are the Blank's**; a Unite
  of different materials takes the Blank's and says which it replaced.
- **Faces keep their names.** The Blank's faces are still `zmax`, `xmin` …; a Tool's are `bore:side`; a face
  the operation cut in pieces is `zmax#1`, `zmax#2`, and a boundary on `zmax` lands on every piece. Edges are
  named by the two faces they separate, `bore:side|zmax`, and that is how a Fillet names what it rounds:
  `"Radius": 50000, "Edges": ["bore:side|zmax"]`. A fillet's new face is `fillet(bore:side|zmax)`. An edge name
  follows its faces through an edit: when `zmax` is split into `zmax.0` and `zmax.1`, a fillet on `xmax|zmax`
  rounds the edges between `xmax` and both pieces. One whose face has gone is refused by name
  (*"Edge 'xmax|zmax' of 'lid' no longer exists: its face 'zmax' was removed"*), never moved to a nearby edge.
- **`"Enabled": false`** makes the operation as if it were not there: the Blank is drawn and solved under the
  boolean's name and each Tool under its own — the bore standing in the lid. A boundary on `bore:side` of `lid`
  then lands on the cylinder's `side`. Nothing in the file changes; switching it back is the A/B test.
- **`"KeepTools": true`** on a Subtract also keeps each Tool as its own solid, right after the result, with its
  own material — how a dielectric fill in a bore is stated.
- **An operation the kernel cannot build** — a fillet larger than the faces beside it, a subtraction that
  leaves nothing — is refused by name, and the rest of the document still elaborates. The edit stays; fix it or
  undo it.

### Making a boolean {#booleans}

Select two or more solids in **Object** mode — **the first one you select is a Tool, the last is the Blank** —
then right-click ▸ **Boolean ▸ Subtract…**, **Unite…** or **Intersect…** (also under **3D ▸ Boolean**). A panel
opens at the view's top right, as *Array…*'s does, and the camera stays free:

- **One row per selected solid**, in the order you selected them. Its radio makes that row the **Blank**; every
  other row is a **Tool**. With two rows, **Swap** exchanges them.
- **The operation** can be changed in the panel's combo. **Keep tools** (Subtract only, off until you tick it,
  remembered while the editor is open) keeps each Tool as a solid of its own beside the result — subtract a
  dielectric slug from a lid and keep the slug as the fill.
- **One line says what the result keeps**: its name and material, and — for a Unite — every material it
  replaces, by name (*"'pin' (Copper) becomes Gold"*).
- **The preview is live.** The result is drawn as it will be, the operands as translucent ghosts (a subtraction's
  Tools in red); a small busy mark shows while the kernel works, and **OK** waits for it. Changing anything asks
  again, and only the newest answer is drawn. A result in several pieces is one object and the panel says so; one
  that leaves nothing, or that the kernel cannot build, is said in red and OK stays disabled.
- **OK** (or **Enter**) is one undo entry — *Subtract bore from lid* — and costs nothing more: the preview already
  built exactly what is committed. **Cancel** (or **Esc**) changes nothing.

Sheets, polylines, bond wires and placed cells are not operands, and the disabled menu item says why for each
(a placed cell's solids belong to its own cell: push into it, or flatten it).

**In the object tree** a boolean is a node with its operation's icon; its **Blank** and then its **Tools** are
beneath it, and a boolean inside a boolean is a node inside a node. By material, a boolean is listed under its
Blank's material and its operands only under it; by type, booleans have a group of their own. Right-click a
boolean for *Edit Operands*, *Dissolve Boolean* (its operands become top-level objects again, the Blank under the
boolean's name) and *Enabled*; right-click a Tool for *Make Blank* and *Remove from Boolean*.

**In Properties** a selected boolean shows its **Operation**, **Enabled**, **Keep tools** and **Blank** (and
**Swap** for two operands), and its material — the Blank's, changed on the Blank. Each change is one undo entry
and is built at once; a change the kernel cannot build is **kept**, and the node is flagged with the reason, so
undo is one keystroke away rather than the combo snapping back.

**Editing an operand.** Double-click a boolean's result (or select it and press **Ctrl/Cmd+]**) to enter it: the
result is drawn as a ghost and its operands solid, and the status line says *Editing operands of 'lid' — Esc to
leave*. An operand then moves, rotates, mirrors, duplicates (the copy is a top-level object), takes a material,
and has its faces and vertices edited, exactly as any object does; a drag moves only its drawing, and the boolean
is built again once, on the release. **Esc** or **Ctrl/Cmd+[** leaves. Clicking an operand's row in the tree
enters its boolean too.

**A result's faces are for reading**: a port, a boundary, Measure, snapping and *Drawing Plane from Face* all use
them, but moving or extruding one is refused — *"'lid' is made by a boolean: edit its operands (double-click it)
or the operation in Properties."*

### Rounding edges: Fillet and Chamfer {#fillets}

Select edges of one solid in **Edge** mode, then right-click ▸ **Fillet…** or **Chamfer…** (also under
**3D ▸ Modify ▸ Edge**). A box, prism, cylinder, polyhedron, boolean result or STEP part can be rounded, and so can a
solid that is already; a sphere has no edges, a sheet has no volume to round, a bond wire is made from its points, and a placed cell's
solids belong to its own cell — each disabled item says which. Without the kernel both are disabled with the
reason, and Edge mode still works.

- **The panel** is the Boolean panel's: **Radius** for a fillet; for a chamfer **Equal distances** or **Two
  distances**, where **Flip** chooses which face the first distance is measured on and a line says which. A size
  is a number or an expression (`r_edge`, `2*t`); a name nothing defines is offered as a VAR, with its value.
- **The edge list** counts the edges and names each, with a **×** to leave one out. The panel does not hold the
  view: click, **Shift**-click or double-click edges while it is open to change the list. The object is drawn
  translucent over the preview so its edges can still be picked; an edge of another object is refused.
- **The preview is live**, as a boolean's is, and **OK** waits for it. A size that does not fit is said in the
  edge's own terms — *"A 50 µm radius does not fit edge 'xmax|zmax': the faces beside it are 30 µm wide. Try less
  than 30 µm."* — and a corner the kernel cannot blend names the edges that meet there.
- **OK** is one undo entry (*Fillet 4 edges of lid*). The fillet **wraps** the solid and **takes its name and its
  place**: every port, boundary and wire on the solid's faces still lands, the faces keep their names, and each new
  face is `fillet(<edge>)` or `chamfer(<edge>)`. A second Fillet… or Chamfer… on the same solid is added beside the
  first: a solid carries any number of them, **one enabled at a time** — the new one is enabled and the others are kept,
  switched off, and switching one on switches the rest off, each in the same undo entry.

**In the object tree** a rounded solid is **one node**, listed as the solid it rounds, with its fillets and
chamfers as rows beneath it, innermost first (*Fillet 50 µm — 4 edges*). **In Properties** a row shows its
**Radius** (or **Distance** and **Distance 2**, and **Flip**), **Enabled**, and its **Edges** — **Show** selects
them in the view and **Edit…** reopens the panel on them — and **Remove** unwraps it: the solid returns unrounded,
in its place and under its name. Each is one undo entry; a change the kernel cannot build is kept and the row
flagged. **Enabled** off draws and solves the solid unrounded, and a boundary on one of the fillet's own faces then
says it *"exists only while its fillet is enabled"*.

**A rounded solid's faces are for reading** too: *"'lid' is rounded by a fillet: edit the box (disable the fillet,
or change it in Properties)."* With every fillet and chamfer on it disabled, its faces and vertices are edited as
the solid's own, and switching them back on rounds the edited solid — an edge still there is rounded again at the
new size.

**Snapping to curves.** On a solid the kernel built, a snap reaches the true vertices only (a curved edge's
drawing points are not vertices), an open curve's midpoint along the curve, and the **centre of a circle or an
arc** — shown as the face-centre marker with a dot in it — which is how a pin is put exactly on a bore's axis. A
point found along a curved edge is on its drawn chord, so the status line marks it **≈**.

<div class="callout warn">
<span class="label">Without the geometry kernel</span>
<p>A development build, or an installation missing its <code>geometry-kernel</code> folder, cannot build
these objects. A 3D view that holds <b>any</b> of them — even a disabled one — is <b>not opened</b>: a dialog

Both solvers take a kernel solid, and they do not treat its curves alike:

- **Palace** reads the kernel's own shape, so a fillet or a bore is meshed as the curved surface it is (second-order
  elements, twelve per full turn). Two things are said before the run: a **warning** where a conductor's curved
  face is under ten skin depths in radius at the bottom of the band — Palace models a conductor's loss as a flat
  surface's, which reads low there — and a **note** where a small radius sets the mesh's size; the operation's
  **Enabled** box is the way to see whether that feature matters.
- **openEMS** reads a tessellation fitted to its grid and **staircases** every curved or sloping face to the grid's
  cells. Each kernel object gets one line about its worst rounded feature: *will not represent* (the cell is wider
  than the radius, so the edge is solved as sharp), *staircases … with about N cells* (a warning below four), or a
  note that refining the grid converges it. A boundary on a curved face is refused for openEMS; Palace takes it.

Those lines appear under each setup in *Simulate ▸ Setup Analyses…*, in `circuitrf check` (at their own severity;
they never change the exit code), and in the run's messages. None of them stops a run. `explain` (which reports the
kernel, each operation's operands, its face and edge counts and its smallest radius) and `render` work on kernel
objects too.

## STEP: importing and exporting {#step}

**STEP** (`.step`, `.stp`) is how a solid model travels between mechanical tools: a connector's maker, a
housing's designer and a CAD package all read and write it. circuitRF reads its solids **into a 3D view**
and writes a 3D view — or a layout — **out as one**. The geometry kernel does both, so without it both
commands are disabled with the reason.

**Import STEP…** (*File ▸ Import ▸ STEP…*) reads the file, off the editor's thread
and cancellable, and opens a table of its parts:

- **Units.** The first line says what the file is in and that it is imported exactly — *File is in
  inches; imported exactly* — because a STEP file states its own unit and every coordinate is converted,
  not guessed.
- **One row per part**: its name, its colour, whether it is a closed solid, the **material** it will take,
  how that was chosen (**Match**: by name, by colour, or chosen), and its path in the file's assembly. A part
  whose name is a material of the technology takes it; failing that, a part whose colour is a material's
  takes that one. The **⇉** button on a row — **Map all of this colour** — gives every part of the row's
  colour the row's material: a connector's brass parts in one gesture. **(no material)** imports a part
  that is drawn and ignored by the solver, and `check` names it.
- **What is not imported, and why.** Only a closed solid can be solved, so a surface, a wire body or an
  open shell is listed, unchecked and disabled, with its reason on its row. Dimensions, tolerances and
  datums (product manufacturing information) are counted in the notes and not imported: they describe
  how to make a part, not what it is.
- **Import** copies the file **into the 3D view's own folder** — so the workspace carries it, and a copy
  that holds the same bytes is reused rather than duplicated — and adds one **Step** object per checked
  part, selected, ready to Move. It is one undo entry, and undoing it removes the copy at the next save.
  The part lands exactly where its file puts it: the file's assembly transform is applied, the object's
  own placement starts at nothing.

A Step object is a solid like any other: it takes a material, moves, and is a boolean operand or a fillet's
target. Its faces are `face1`, `face2` … as the file's shape numbers them, and they mean something only for
those bytes — which is why the object records the file's **Hash**. When the source file changes (a new
revision from the maker), **Reload from Source** on the object's menu reads it again and re-matches every
port, boundary and fillet on it **by geometry**, then says what moved; a part the new file no longer has is
said by name. A part the new file adds is offered in the import table, unchecked.

**Export STEP…** (*File ▸ Export ▸ STEP…*) writes the active 3D view or layout:

- **Structure**: **Flattened** writes one product per solid; **As assembly** writes each placed cell as a
  sub-assembly, once, however many times it is placed.
- **Overlaps**: **Precedence applied** writes disjoint solids, cut exactly as the solver gets them — metal
  over dielectric, then construction order, so a via is a hole through the substrate with the via in it.
  **As drawn** writes every solid whole, overlapping where it was drawn.
- **Thicken sheets** gives each sheet its stated thickness, for a receiving tool that drops surfaces;
  **Include air box** adds the first 3D setup's air box as one uncoloured solid, for checking clearance to
  a housing. **Schema**: AP214 (the widest read) or AP242.
- **Units** follow the design: millimetres for a design in nm, µm or mm; inches for one in mil or inch.
  Each product carries its object's name and its material's colour, and the header names circuitRF and its
  version. A summary line says what will be written before anything is.

The **3D Connector** example's flange was made this way: drawn in its own cell, exported, and imported into
the launch — see [the second example](#connector).

## The realistic view {#realistic}

The **Realistic view** button on the toolbar (the camera aperture, after Perspective and Orthographic), *3D ▸ View ▸
Realistic View* and the **L** key in the view all redraw the view with physically based materials lit by a studio: metals reflect it, dielectrics take
their body colour, gloss and translucency from their [appearance](#appearance). It is for pictures. It is a **view**,
not an edit: it changes nothing in the model or in any result, and it is not saved in the design. Every design opens
with it off unless {{anchor: settings.html#general|Settings ▸ General ▸ Open in realistic view}} is on.
Selecting, hovering, modelling and the clip plane all keep working underneath it.

The first time a studio is used in a session it is prepared in the background, and until then the view is drawn as
usual; the status line says *Realistic · preparing …* and then names the environment and the exposure.

**What steps aside.** The CAD chrome is hidden: the edge lines, the drawing grid, the mesh, FDTD-grid and section
overlays, the air box, ports, boundaries and face tints, and reference images. The selected object's outline and the
face-mode highlights stay, because it is still the editor. A [field plot](#simulate) is drawn exactly as in the
ordinary view unless you choose otherwise (see [Field plots in the realistic view](#realistic-fields)). An object's stated [transparency](#transparency) still applies;
a dielectric's ordinary see-through look does not, because the appearance's `Transmission` decides that here.
*Copy* and *Export Picture…* draw the realistic view without the hover or the selection.

**The `Look` block.** How the scene is lit is saved in the `.c3d`, so a picture can be made again later. Every key is
optional; an omitted key takes the default shown:

```json
"Look": {
  "Environment": "Studio",
  "Rotation": 30,
  "Intensity": 1.0,
  "Exposure": 0.0,
  "Background": "Theme",
  "ShowPorts": false
}
```

| Key | Values |
|---|---|
| `Environment` | `Studio` (soft), `HighKey` (white, low contrast), `Dark` (a black room with strong rim lights), or a Radiance `.hdr` file's path, relative to the `.c3d` |
| `Rotation` | degrees about +z, turning the studio around the model |
| `Intensity` | 0–10, the environment's brightness |
| `Exposure` | −10 to +10 EV |
| `Background` | `Theme` (the view's own colour), `#rrggbb`, `"#rrggbb,#rrggbb"` (a vertical gradient, top colour first) or `Environment` (the studio itself) |
| `ShowEdges`, `ShowGrid`, `ShowOverlays`, `ShowAirBox`, `ShowPorts`, `ShowBoundaries`, `ShowImages` | `true` brings that item back, drawn exactly as the ordinary view draws it |
| `Shadows` | `false` turns off the key light's shadows (default on) |
| `AmbientOcclusion` | `false` turns off the contact shading where surfaces meet (default on) |
| `Ground` | `false` removes the shadow-catching floor under the model (default on) |
| `Camera` | the camera pictures are taken from, written only by *Set Camera* (below): `Direction` (from the target toward the viewer), `Target` and `Distance` in DBU, `FovY` in degrees, `Projection` |
| `FieldStyle` | `Exact` (the default), `Lit` or `Glow`: how a field plot is drawn (below) |
| `FieldOpacity` | 0–100, default 100: below 100 the material under a field plot shows through its colours |

A `Show…` key only lifts the realistic view's own hiding: an air box you have hidden, an overlay that is off, or a
hidden object stays hidden. The Look is edited in the [Look panel](#look-panel), or by writing the file. A `Look` edit is
undone like any other, and **no run sees it**: editing it never makes a result stale.

**Your own environment.** Name a Radiance `.hdr` (an equirectangular image, +z up) instead of a studio. An `.exr` is not
read. A file that is missing or does not read is a warning in `check`; the view then lights the scene with Studio and
the status line says why.

**Shadows, contact shading and the ground.** The studio's key light casts **shadows**: soft from High key's broad
softbox, crisp from Dark's small one. An object whose appearance lets half or more of the light through (`Transmission`
0.5 or more) casts none, and ports, boundaries and field plots never do. **Contact shading** darkens the ambient light
where surfaces meet, such as a die on its substrate or a wire's foot on its pad; it is worked out from what the view shows,
so it follows the camera. The **ground** is a floor just under the model's lowest point that draws only those two
darkenings, so the model rests on something instead of floating. It is never seen from below, and the section plane does
not cut it. A field plot's colours are never shadowed or shaded. Each of the three can be turned off in the `Look`.

**How it is drawn.** The colours go through the Khronos PBR Neutral tone curve, which keeps base colours faithful. A
glossy surface reflects the studio, a rough one spreads it. Translucency is approximated: what shows through is dimmed
and tinted by the attenuation colour, and the reflection is added on top, but light is not bent: the view is drawn at
interactive speed, not ray traced.

### Field plots in the realistic view {#realistic-fields}

A field plot's colour is a measurement, read against its legend, so by default the realistic view leaves it alone:
everything around the field is lit, and the field itself is the colour map's own colour, exactly as in the ordinary view.
Exposure, the tone curve, shadows and contact shading never touch it. The `FieldStyle` key, or *Field plots* in the
[Look panel](#look-panel), offers two other styles for pictures that want more drama:

| Style | What it does | The field's colours |
|---|---|---|
| `Exact` | Nothing: the field is drawn as a flat, unlit colour map. | exactly the legend's |
| `Lit` | A clear-coat sheen on the field, from the studio and its key light, so it looks like a coating on the part. The sheen only ever lightens a colour toward white, and never changes its hue. | lightened where the sheen falls |
| `Glow` | The field stays exact and the model and background around it are dimmed by 2.5 stops, so the field seems to glow. | exactly the legend's |

`FieldOpacity` below 100 lets the material under a plot show through it: a field painted on copper then reads as copper
under the colours. A plot that normally replaces the faces it is painted on draws them under it instead.

**The indicator.** When the colours are no longer exactly the legend's, the picture says so: a small **Lit Fields**
label under the field legend with `Lit`, **Blended Fields** with an opacity below 100, and **Lit, Blended Fields** with
both. With the legend turned off, the label sits alone in that corner. It is in the view and in every picture (*Copy*
and *Export Picture…*), whatever the legend and caption options say, and it cannot be turned off. `Exact` and `Glow`
carry no label.

**A field seen through glass.** A [clip-plane](#simulate) slice inside a substrate whose appearance has `Transmission`
(fused silica, or your own) shows the field inside the material through it.

### Changing how things look {#changing-look}

There are two places to change an [appearance](#appearance), and the choice is about **how many things** should change.

- **The material route** changes everything made of that material, in every design on the technology. Open the
  Materials editor — *Edit Material…* on an object, *3D ▸ Materials…*, the technology's Materials tab or the `.cmat`
  itself — and use the material's **Appearance** card. Use it to make copper look like copper everywhere, or to tune a
  library's dielectrics once.
- **The object route** changes the selected objects only. Select them (Object mode) and use the **Appearance** group in
  the Inspector, under Transparency. Use it for the exceptions: the one gold-plated trace, a polished lid, a part that
  should stand out in a picture. It works for a placed cell too, and its parts inherit it.

Both show the same fields. A field that is stated shows its value; one that is not shows, greyed, the value it takes,
and its tooltip says where that comes from (`role default`, `Like 'Gold'`, `material 'Copper' (generic-materials.cmat)`).
The **×** beside a field removes the statement, so the field comes from the next one down again; *Clear override*
removes an object's whole appearance. Several objects whose values differ read *mixed*, and an edit writes all of them.

**Plating is `Like`.** Choose *Gold* in the **Like** box on a copper trace and it takes gold's whole look; any field it
states itself still wins, so *Like Gold* with a higher Roughness is brushed gold. The same box on a material makes one
material look like another (a solder alloy like tin) without restating its numbers.

**Live.** Dragging a slider shows the result in the 3D view as you drag, and the change is one undo step when you let
go. In the Materials editor a sphere swatch shows the material under the default studio, so a look can be judged with no
3D view open. In the Materials dialog every change is shown in each open 3D view on that technology while the dialog is
open; *Cancel* puts the view back exactly as it was. Neither route rebuilds the model: the view only redraws its
materials. Editing works whether the realistic view is on or not; while it is off, the Inspector's group says so and
turns it on in one click.

<a id="look-panel"></a>**The Look panel** opens from the small arrow beside the Realistic view button, or from *3D ▸ View ▸
Look…*. Opening it turns the realistic view on, since that is what it changes. It holds the environment (a studio, or
*Load .hdr…*), its rotation, intensity and exposure, the background and its colours (a swatch opens a picker inside the panel; *Done* keeps the colour), Shadows, Contact shading and
Ground, the [field plots'](#realistic-fields) style and opacity, and one **Show** box for each kind of CAD chrome the realistic view hides. Every change is saved with the design
and is one undo step; a slider is one step per drag. The **×** beside a number puts it back to its default (rotation 30°,
intensity 1, exposure 0 EV, field opacity 100 %), also one undo step. A new `.hdr` is prepared in the background and the old environment
stays on screen until it is ready; one used before comes back at once.

{{ui: em3d-look-panel}}

**A picture's camera.** The camera is not normally saved with a design. *Set Camera* in the Look panel
is the one exception: it saves the current view, and *Export Picture…*, `render` and a glTF export take their picture
from it. Orbiting afterwards never changes it. *Go to Camera View* brings the live view back to it; *Clear* removes it,
and pictures follow the live view again.

**None of this touches a result.** An appearance, a material's display colour, the Look and the picture camera are
display only. A run never reads them, and changing any of them, in the design or in a material library, never makes a
result out of date.

## Pictures and drawings {#drawings}

Right-click the view (on anything, or on nothing) for five ways to take it out of circuitRF:

- **Copy** puts a picture of the view on the clipboard, drawn by the graphics card at a multiple of the
  window's size. **Export Picture…** saves the same picture as a PNG. In the [realistic view](#realistic), the picture
  is drawn at **Supersampling** times its size each way (1×, 2× by default, or 4× for a final picture) and brought
  down, so edges are smooth; the saved size is still the one you chose. **Transparent background** (realistic view
  only) leaves out the background: the PNG's alpha holds the model, a glass object's partial cover, and the ground's
  soft shadow, ready to place on a slide of any colour.
- **Copy as Vector** puts the view on the clipboard as **lines**: every silhouette and sharp edge, seen
  along the camera's direction, with the edges behind a surface removed — what the shaded view shows, drawn
  as a line drawing. It pastes into a slide or a document as a picture that stays sharp at any size: on
  Windows as a metafile, on macOS and Linux as PDF and SVG, with a PNG beside them for anything that takes
  neither. **Export as Vector…** saves the same drawing as an SVG or PDF file.
- **Export Drawing…** (also *File ▸ Export ▸ Drawing…* while a 3D view is the active document) lays several
  views out on one sheet, as SVG or PDF.

A vector picture is drawn as the view is — in **perspective** when the view is, from the camera's own eye, at the
scale the view has at its orbit centre, and **orthographic** otherwise — and it leaves out what you have hidden. It is framed as the view is, at the view's zoom — zoom in for a close-up. Conductors keep the
colours the view draws them in; dielectrics are outlined in grey.

An object given a [transparency](#transparency) above 0 **hides nothing** in a vector picture or a drawing: the edges
behind it are drawn as solid lines, as seeing through it means on paper, while it keeps its own edges. A section fills
it at its transparency.

Every picture carries what the toolbar's middle group shows: the **axis indicator**, the **drawing grid** and
the **scale legend** (the scale bar, bottom right; also *3D ▸ View ▸ Scale Legend*) — turn one off and it
leaves the pictures too. *Copy* and *Export Picture…* also keep a measurement with its numbers and the
selection's highlight; neither keeps the cursor's hover label, the snap marker or the move handles. A vector
picture has no drawing grid.

### Export Drawing… {#export-drawing}

The dialog chooses what goes on the sheet:

- **Views**: *Isometric*, *Top*, *Front*, *Right*, *Left*, *Back*, *Bottom* — each an outline looking along
  the direction the matching *Standard View* looks, so *Top* on paper is *Top* on screen. Top comes first, so
  on two columns it sits above Front with Right beside it.
- **Sections**: **Add Section** adds a cut through the model — **XY** at a height *z*, **XZ** at a *y*,
  **YZ** at an *x* — starting at the model's centre. Type the position **with its unit** (`1.2mm`, `350um`,
  `40mil`); a bare number is refused, as `render --section` refuses one, because nanometres, micrometres and
  millimetres are all plausible. A section is drawn filled, each material in its colour, and lettered
  *Section A–A*, *B–B* … in order.
- **Hidden edges**: **Removed** (the default) draws only what faces you; **Dashed** draws the edges behind a
  surface as thin dashed lines, the drafting convention; **Shown** draws every edge, a wire-frame. Sections
  show the inside of a closed part better than dashed lines do, which is why Removed is the default.
- **Material legend**, and **Leave out what the 3D view hides** (on by default).
- **Text as outlines** (on by default): every label is drawn as the shapes of its letters, so the file looks
  the same on every machine and in every program. Turned off, the labels are real text you can select and
  edit — but they name the font *IBM Plex Sans*, and a reader without it installed sees another font in its
  place.
- **Page** (A4, Letter, A3, Tabloid, portrait or landscape) and **Format** (PDF or SVG).

**Every view is at one scale**, a round one — *5:1*, *2:1*, *1:10* — chosen as the largest that fits every
view, and stated in the title block with the document's name. A length measured on one view can be compared
with another, and with a ruler on the printed page. The dialog remembers its choices (not its sections) for
next time.

Working out which edges are hidden takes a moment on a large model; above 400,000 triangles it is skipped,
the edges are all drawn, and the message that reports the export says so.

## Exporting for another renderer {#gltf}

circuitRF does not ray-trace. When a picture needs what only a path tracer gives — refraction through a glass lid,
caustics, light bouncing between parts — **File ▸ Export ▸ glTF…** writes the model as one binary glTF file (`.glb`),
which every path tracer and most 3D tools open. The [realistic view](#realistic) approximates those effects; the other
renderer computes them.

What is written is **what the view draws**: every shown solid and sheet, with the same triangles and the smooth
normals the realistic view shades with. A hidden object is left out, and so are the air box, ports, boundaries and
face tints, the grid, and reference images. An object left out of the solve (*Model* off) is written: it is drawn.
Names come along: each object is a node named as in the tree, and each group is a parent node.

Each [appearance](#appearance) becomes a glTF material with the same numbers, since circuitRF's appearance is glTF's
own metallic-roughness model. Base colour, metallic and roughness are always written; transmission, index of
refraction, clearcoat and the volume's attenuation are written only where they differ from glTF's defaults, as
optional extensions, so a viewer that does not know one still opens the file. A material is named after the
circuitRF material, with `+override` added where an object's own appearance changed it. The volume's thickness is
the object's smallest extent, which is an approximation and the export notes say so.

The dialog offers:

- **Flattened** or **Assembly**. With Assembly on, a placed cell is a node and its parts' meshes are written once,
  however often it is placed.
- **Include camera**: the current view as the file's camera, so the other renderer opens on the same framing.
- **Include field plot**: a drawn Surfaces or Faces plot as a separate mesh, coloured per vertex at the current
  phase and range, with an *unlit* material so a renderer that honours it shows the colours unshaded, as the view
  does. The parts the plot stands in for are left out, as the view leaves them out. The view colours each pixel from
  the field's value, but a file can only colour the corners of triangles, so the export divides each field triangle
  until no edge spans more than a sixteenth of the colour range, up to four times. The summary says how many
  triangles that made.

The summary line counts the objects, triangles and materials and names the extensions the file will use, before
anything is written.

circuitRF's model is **z-up**; glTF's is **y-up**. The file's top node turns the model so it stands up in every
viewer, and moves it to where it sits in the design. Lengths are in metres, glTF's unit and circuitRF's.

`circuitrf convert x.c3d -o x.glb` writes the same file headlessly; see [From the command line](#headless).

## Hierarchy: placing cells {#hierarchy}

**Design ▸ Place Cell Instance…** with a 3D view active offers every cell with a **3D view** or a
**layout**, and a **View** choice between them. The example places the *Thru die* cell's **layout**: a
layout comes in through its own technology's stackup, bottom up — back-side metal, 100 µm of GaAs, the
metal on top — bounded by its board outline, the die edge. Its objects are named `U1/…` (`U1/GaAs`,
`U1/Metal1/1`), and its conductors are pads a wire can land on.

- **The placement point** is the child's origin. Hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd**) while placing to use its
  **bottom-centre** instead — the **die-attach handle**: the die is dropped with its back side flat on
  whatever you click, which is how U1 sits on the attach pad.
- **Why a different technology is allowed here, and not in a layout.** A layout instance must share its
  parent's technology because layouts match layers **by number**: layer 1 in a GaAs process and layer 1 in
  a board process are different things, and mixing them would be silently wrong. A 3D view matches nothing
  by layer. Every instance arrives as solids in **metres** made of **named materials**, so a GaAs die in an
  alumina package is exactly what it says. Two technologies' materials with the same name merge when they
  are equal (the example's *Gold* is one material) and are told apart as `name@technology` when they are
  not.
- **Swap View** (right-click an instance) switches it between the child's layout and its 3D view, keeping
  its placement. *Thru die* has no 3D view, so in the example the item is disabled and its tooltip says
  why. A port or boundary that named a conductor inside the instance is reported if the other view has no
  object of that name.
- **Array…** on one instance sets that instance's own array — one child, drawn many times.
- **Push Into Cell** (**Ctrl/Cmd+]**) opens a 3D child in this editor, in context — the parent drawn dimmed
  around it — or a layout child in the layout editor. **Pop Out** (**Ctrl/Cmd+[**) returns.
- **Flatten** replaces an instance with its objects (a layout's become solids; it asks first, stating how
  many). **Group into Cell…** does the reverse for selected objects, without moving them.

### A placed layout's dielectric {#layout-dielectric}

A placed layout's dielectrics are drawn, and they are **part of the problem** Palace and openEMS solve. A
stackup gives a dielectric no outline, so each slab is cut to one of these, the first that exists:

- The layout's **board outline**, as with the die edge above.
- The **outline of the copper directly above and below it**, with gaps closed, holes filled and a margin of
  2 dielectric stack heights past the copper. This keeps the substrate in a coplanar line's gaps and beside
  every trace, where its fringing field runs.
- The bounding box of everything drawn, if there is no copper above or below it.

The Messages note for the build says which one each slab took. Draw a board outline when the board's real
edge matters. The whole rule, and how it differs from a planar setup's laterally infinite dielectric, is
in [3D EM ▸ How far the dielectric reaches](em-3d.html#dielectrics).

## Bond wires {#wires}

**Shift+A W** (or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Wire*). A wire runs between two metal objects: click the one it starts on
(any face — it lands on that object's **top**, above the point clicked), then the one it ends on, then move
to set the **loop height** and click, or type it. The toolbar sets the diameter, the metal, each end's bond
(**ball** or **wedge**) and the section. Across hierarchy is the usual case: the example's wires start on
the die's pads, inside U1, and end on the package's leads, which a `.wBond` cannot do because it belongs to
one layout.

- **The loop height you type is the one the wire measures**, the assembly way: from the top of the lower
  pad to the top of the wire at its highest point. The example's are **8 mil**, typed.
- In Vertex mode a wire's centre-line points are handles; **G** moves one, and the feet are put back on the
  pads when you let go. Properties lists every point, editable.
- Properties also takes a wire's **loop height** and **span**, as a wBond or Layout wire does: a loop height
  scales the wire's rise above its feet and keeps every x and y; a span moves the end foot along the wire's
  direction, the start staying put, and the end must land on a pad. Its **diameter** is in the display unit,
  like every other length there.
- **A wire does not follow its pad.** Re-routing would change its inductance without telling you, so a
  wire whose pad has moved is drawn red, flagged in the tree, and refused by a run. *Re-Seat Wire Ends*
  puts each end back on the pad now under it.
- Clicking a pad **through the lid** lands on the lid, which is metal too. Hide the lid first, or draw the
  wires before it — the example did both in that order.

## Simulating {#simulate}

**Setups.** A 3D view carries its own EM setups. *Simulate ▸ Setup Analyses…* (or the toolbar's tune
button) lists them as cards: *Add*, *Duplicate*, *Rename*, *Remove*, *Make Active*; a double-click opens
the same panel a `.cem` opens, less the layout row. The example has two: **Driven**, a Palace S-parameter
sweep from 2 to 30 GHz, and **Lid modes**, a Palace eigenmode solve. The **active** setup is the one
**Run** runs and whose air box is drawn.

**Ports.** **Shift+A P** draws one on the drawing plane, two corners; or right-click a flat rectangular
face, *Make Port ▸ Lumped* or *Wave*. **Which kind a face can take depends on where it lies, not on what it
was drawn as**: a wave port is a region of an air-box face (a sheet drawn there is the usual way to state one),
and a lumped port bridges two conductors on opposite edges (a face of a small gap block does exactly that). The
menu offers only the kind that would resolve, and the other's tip says why. **Which way round a lumped port is comes from what it touches**: each
edge is tested against every conductor, one opposite pair must touch one conductor each, and the one that
is ground — or failing that, the larger — is **−**. A lumped port is drawn as a two-colour checkerboard
over exactly its own rectangle — from its − edge to its + edge and across its full width — with its number
and a flat arrow painted on it, centred, pointing to the + edge; anything in front of the port hides it,
arrow and all. While it is drawn, the arrow (or the reason there cannot be one) follows the cursor. The example's
two ports are 5 × 5 mil rectangles on the YZ plane at each lead's outer end, from the floor up to the lead:
each runs **from `floor` (−) up to its lead (+)**. *Flip* on its menu turns it round; a wrong arrow turns
every transmission term by 180°, so look before a run.

**The air box** is the region solved in: each face a distance beyond the geometry, and a boundary — PEC,
PMC, symmetry or absorbing — chosen by right-clicking the face. The example's package **is** its own
shield: both setups set every face to PEC with **no padding**, so the box lies flush against the floor,
the walls and the lid, and nothing outside the metal is meshed. **Boundaries on faces** (right-click a
dielectric's face: *Perfect Conductor*, *Conductive Surface*) put a wall inside the model without drawing
metal.

**Solved marks.** Each setup's card says whether its last result still matches the model, and the tab and the workspace
tree mark a 3D view whose results do. See [3D EM ▸ Is this solved?](em-3d.html#solved).

**Run.** *Simulate ▸ Run* (or the workspace toolbar's Run). Palace or openEMS is started with the same
progress, **Cancel** and messages as any EM run, and the result opens in the Data Display. Afterwards the
**Field** bar shows the saved fields on the geometry that was solved. On a machine without the solver, Run
is refused and offers to install it — and that is the only gesture on this page that needed one.

**What the example gives.** Every figure was measured once, on an Apple M4 with 10 cores and 16 GB,
running macOS 27.0, Palace 0.18.1 and Gmsh 4.15.2; yours will differ.

- **Driven** (2–30 GHz, 1,121 points): **4 min 46 s**, peak **6.4 GB**. |S21| is **−0.41 dB** at the band
  centre, 16 GHz, and falls to **−5.35 dB** in a notch about 50 MHz wide at 22.15 GHz — the lid's resonance,
  below, seen from outside.
- Both setups run at **Draft with element order 2**, with *At metal and ports* at **1** and the **Direct** linear
  solver, chosen so each finishes in under five minutes. Every wall here is metal, so the default refinement at
  metal would fill the whole cavity with fine elements; order 2 is what resolves the notch, and *Direct* is what
  makes it fast. The example's `README.md` gives what each alternative measured.

## The lid's resonance {#lid}

A lid turns a package into a **cavity**, and a cavity has resonant modes. The lowest, for a cavity much
wider than it is tall, has its electric field pointing from the floor up to the lid, strongest in the
middle — exactly where the die is. If that mode lands inside the band the circuit works in, the package
couples the output back to the input through it: the classic package problem. The **Lid modes** setup
finds it directly, with an eigenmode solve.

**Lid modes** (the one mode above 20 GHz): **35 s** of Palace, peak **4.0 GB**. The mode is at **22.16 GHz**
with a Q of **318** — the gold, the lid alloy and the ports' 50 Ω all load it — and it is the driven sweep's notch.

**The external check.** The closed form for a rectangular cavity 400 × 320 × 40 mil with a 5 mil alumina slab on
its floor puts the lowest mode at **22.23 GHz**. That is the one number in this section that is not circuitRF's
own output. The drawn package is 0.3 % lower: the die, its pad, the leads and the wires are what the closed form
leaves out.

**Move the mode.** Set `cav_w` to `480` in the Variables panel: the walls, floor, base and lid move out and the
die stays put. The closed form then says 20.87 GHz — a mode below 22 GHz, walking toward the band — and **Run**
on *Lid modes* finds where the drawn package puts it.

## Temperature {#thermal}

The same model solves for heat. A **thermal setup** (*Simulate ▸ Setup Analyses…*, the thermometer button — or any setup
whose *Solver* is set to **Thermal**) is solved by circuitRF's own steady-conduction solver after Gmsh meshes every solid
— air is not meshed. What it needs is drawn in the
view, and what it is worth is typed in the setup, so one model carries several thermal setups beside its EM ones.
What a run models, and three worked examples with their numbers (*Tools ▸ Examples ▸ Thermal: …*), are in
{{anchor: thermal.html|Thermal}}; this section is the gestures.

<figure class="figure fixed"><span class="frame">
    <img src="../assets/fixed/output-wires-dc-along-wire.png" alt="A gold bond wire in a mould compound, cut along its length: the wire hottest at mid-span, the heat spreading into the mould around it">
  </span><figcaption>A thermal run of <em>Thermal Output Wires</em>: a bond wire carrying current inside a package's overmold, cut
  along its length. The wire is coloured from its own solved temperature, the mould compound around it from the 3D field.</figcaption></figure>

**The places.** These are drawn in the view but are not objects: they are never solved as metal, never snapped to, and an
EM setup ignores them. Each has a group in the object tree (*Heat sources*, *Probes*, *Mesh regions*) whose rows select,
rename, hide and delete, and a switch under *3D ▸ View*. Selecting a row shows its fields in Properties, dimensions
included, each a number or an expression.

- **Heat source** (**Shift+A H**, or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Heat Source ▸ Rectangle / Polygon*): drawn as a port's sheet is — put the
  drawing plane on the face first (**Ctrl/Cmd**-click it) — then named and given a default power in W. Right-click a solid,
  *Heat Source from Solid*, spreads the heat through its whole volume instead. Drawn hatched in orange.
- **Probe** (**Shift+A T**, or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Probe ▸ Point / Spot / Line*): a point on a face; a spot (its centre, then its
  diameter — what an IR microscope averages); or a line (two points: temperature along it). Right-click a face (Face mode)
  or a solid or a wire (Object mode), *Add Probe*, for a probe over the whole face, solid or wire. A probe may state a limit
  in °C; the results flag where it is crossed.
- **Mesh region** (**Shift+A M**, or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Mesh Region*): a box, drawn as a Box is, with the element size inside it —
  fine mesh where you put it. Drawn dashed.

**Boundaries.** Every face nothing names is insulated. In Face mode, right-click a face, *Thermal ▸ Fixed Temperature…*,
*Convection…*, *Insulated* or *Clear*: each writes the **active** thermal setup (greyed, saying why, when the active setup
is not a thermal one). A conditioned face is tinted — **blue** a fixed temperature, **green** convection — and listed under
*Thermal boundaries* in the tree. Untick a boundary's row to stop drawing its tint (in this view only: the boundary still
applies). Click the tint, or its row, and Properties edits it — *Kind*, *T* or *h* and *Ambient*, each a number or an
expression, and *Select face* for the face under it. With two touching objects selected, *Thermal ▸ Contact Resistance…* overrides the
technology's interface resistance for that contact, prefilled with the technology's value when it states one.

**Contacts.** Where two solids touch, heat crosses perfectly unless a resistance is stated: the technology's
*ThermalInterfaces* give one for a pair of materials (GaN on SiC, a die attach), and a document's contact override
replaces it for one contact only. The run splits the contact — each side keeps its own nodes — and joins the two through
the resistance, so a clip plane through a die attach shows the temperature step. The run's notes list every contact in
force, where its value came from and the area it covers.

**Effective blocks** (*3D ▸ Draw ▸ Effective Block*): a box drawn over a via field, as a mesh region is. **Enabled**, a
thermal run replaces the board dielectric, copper planes and via barrels inside it with one block conducting
(k_xy, k_xy, k_z) — hundreds of thin barrels stop forcing tiny elements. It is an **approximation** and is drawn
**disabled**: enable it from its row or in Properties, which show the tensor it would carry; disabled, the geometry is
solved as drawn, so comparing the two is one toggle. A box that cuts into anything else (a flange, a die) is refused,
naming it. The mixture, per layer of the box (every height a replaced solid starts or stops), from the area fractions of
copper, dielectric and void measured exactly over the box's footprint:

- through the layer, k_z = f_Cu·k_Cu + f_d·k_d;
- in the plane, the layer's largest phase is the matrix and the rest are inclusions (parallel cylinders) at their
  area-weighted k_i and fraction φ: k_xy = k_m·[(k_i + k_m) + φ(k_i − k_m)] / [(k_i + k_m) − φ(k_i − k_m)];
- the layers stack: k_z in series over their thicknesses, k_xy in parallel.

Each material's k at 25 °C is used, so the block's tensor is constant. It ignores how heat crowds into each barrel through
a thin plane, which makes it run cooler than the vias drawn — measure the difference on your own board before trusting it.

**Submodels.** A thermal setup whose Thermal page says *Submodel: cut from* another thermal setup, *to region* a mesh
region, solves only that region's box, meshed at the region's size, with its cut faces fixed to the other setup's
solution; every other boundary is as written. The whole-model result is reused only when the document and every file it
was solved from are as they were — a placed layout, the technology, a material library — and solved first when they are
not (the notes say which, naming the file that changed). A mesh region a submodel is cut to no longer refines the whole-model
run — that is what keeps it coarse. The run compares the heat crossing the cut faces with the whole model's over the same
faces and **warns when they differ by more than 5 %** point by point: the region is too small, the fine detail changes
the temperature at its edge, enlarge it. A heat source straddling the box is refused; one inside must carry the same power
as in the whole model.

**Symmetry.** Model half (or a quarter) of a symmetric device: right-click the face you cut it on, *Symmetry Plane*. The
plane is drawn hatched across the model where it cuts it, labelled `Symmetry X = …`, and listed under *Symmetry planes*,
whose tick shows or hides it; select its row to move it in Properties (*At*, a length or an expression). It must lie on the
model's extent; it stays insulated (a condition on it is refused), and *All exposed faces* never
takes it. What is drawn is what is solved: give the sources the power of the modelled part. Measures read
`SymmetryFactor` (2 per plane) so a whole-device figure is explicit — `Rth_full = (Tmax(ch) - 25) / (Pdiss *
SymmetryFactor)`; nothing is multiplied silently. A plotted temperature is drawn mirrored across the planes (*3D ▸ View ▸
Temperature ▸ Mirror Symmetric Halves* turns it off), and hovering the mirrored half reads the modelled point's value and
says so.

**The setup's Thermal page**, top to bottom: **Sources** (each heat source's default, and this setup's override),
**Boundaries** (the list the menu writes, and *All exposed faces: convection* at an h and an ambient), **Sweep** (up to two
variables), **Measures** (one per line — `Rth = (Tmax(die) - Tavg(flange)) / Pdiss` — checked as you type), **Mesh** (order,
elements across a source and through the thinnest solid, grading, the solver, the convergence check), and **Balance** (k(T)
on or off), **Submodel** (above), and the three small-signal sections below — **Rth matrix**, **Thermal impedance** and
**Pulse train**. Under Mesh, the size of the run is estimated before anything is meshed.

**Plot Temperature.** A temperature picture is a **field plot** — a row of the tree's *Field Plots* group, saved with the
document, edited in the Properties Inspector (see {{anchor: em-3d.html#view|the 3D view}}). After a run of the active
thermal setup, right-click a face, *Plot Temperature*, to add that face to the temperature plot being drawn, or start one
with it (again to take it off; several faces accumulate); *3D ▸ View ▸ Temperature ▸ All Faces* draws a plot on every
exposed face, and *On Clip Plane* one on the clip plane's section — the way to see a channel under a field plate. The
items are greyed, with the reason, when there is no thermal result or the model has changed since it ran. The colour
range is the **true** minimum and maximum of what is painted — the peak is the answer, so it is never clipped — and the
legend reads °C; the plot's *Fix range across the sweep* (or *Fix Range Across Sweep* in the menu) makes it the minimum
and maximum over every sweep point, so stepping the sweep never rescales the colours. The plot's *Solution* is the sweep
point shown. When the run has more than one point, a **sweep slider** at the view's top left moves the drawn plot to
another point: one control per swept variable, labelled with its value and unit (`Pdiss = 7 W`). Dragging it shows the
points as it passes them, and letting go keeps the point shown as the plot's *Solution*, one undo step. ◀ and ▶ move one point
each. The probe table, the line plots and the hot spot follow it. Hover a painted face for the temperature there (interpolated, not the nearest
node); a ring marks the **hot spot** with its temperature and its object. A bond wire whose run tabulated its temperature
is coloured along its length, and hovering it names the wire and the distance along it.

**Along a line.** *Along…* on the toolbar (or *3D ▸ View ▸ Temperature ▸ Temperature Along…*) takes two points and plots
the temperature between them, with both end temperatures and their difference — Rth by hand, with nothing added to the
document. A line probe's row in the tree plots its own, *Plot T(s)*. **Probes** on the toolbar lists every probe
statistic and every measure at the sweep point shown, a column per point on request, with any probe past its limit in
orange.

### Rth matrix, Z_th and pulses {#thermal-rth}

They are read off the same mesh after the sweep, at its first point, each
with **every boundary made homogeneous** (fixed temperatures and ambients 0) — so they are properties of the structure,
not of the heatsink temperature. With k(T) on they are the small-signal response about that point's temperatures, and the
notes say so.

- **Rth matrix**: R_ij is the rise of heat source i's place per watt in source j (every source, or the ones named). *Mean*
  (the default) reads each source's average rise, and the matrix is symmetric — the run reports its largest asymmetry as a
  check on the solve; *Hottest point* reads each source's maximum, which is not symmetric. The run also gives each
  source's rise under the setup's own powers, R·P. `circuitrf em` prints the matrix, rows and columns named.
- **Thermal impedance** Z_th(jω), from DC over a logarithmic band (0.01 Hz to 1 MHz, 10 per decade, unless stated): every
  source's own place per watt in each source, and each named probe (its mean) per watt in each. **Every meshed material
  must state DensityKgM3 and SpecificHeat**; one that does not is refused, named with its objects. Right-click a heat
  source's or a probe's row, *Plot |Z_th|* or *Plot Z_th phase*, for the curve against log frequency.
- **Foster networks.** Each Z_th is fitted as Σ Rᵢ/(1 + jωτᵢ) with every Rᵢ ≥ 0 (so the network is passive) and ΣRᵢ equal
  to the Rth; the fit's largest error over the band is in the notes, and above 2 % the run warns — raise *per decade*. Each
  source's own network is written beside the result as `<result>.<source>.foster.cnl`: Rᵢ ∥ Cᵢ stages between a thermal
  pin and a reference pin, power as current and temperature rise as voltage. Its internal nodes are not temperatures, and
  it is not attached to any device. The file carries a one-port bench, so `circuitrf sparam` on it reads the network's
  Z_th back.
- **Pulse train**: a period (`1 ms`, `100 us`), a duty, and optionally the total power during the pulse (shared by the
  sources in proportion to their own; empty, each at its own power). There is no transient solver. The periodic peak and
  the average come from Z_th solved **exactly at the harmonics of 1/period**, as many as it takes until each further one
  adds less than 10⁻⁴ of the average rise, up to the band's top. Above the last harmonic, a source's own place is carried by its
  Foster network. Heat from another source, or at a probe, gets nothing there: it has to travel, so it is small at high
  frequency. The Foster fit of such a **transfer** Z_th is not used: heat that has to travel arrives late, its Z_th goes
  negative at high frequency, and no sum of RC stages can do that. The **single pulse** is the train's first pulse from
  rest, highest before the second begins, from the same solved values. Each is added to the place's temperature with no
  power, for every Z_th place at every sweep point. The duty and period are expressions, so they sweep. They are rows of the
  Probes table, and the waveform over one period is in the result. A probe on a heat source converges slowly this way,
  since it has no fit of its own; the run warns when a place had not converged by the band's top.

## From the command line {#headless}

Every step above has a command-line spelling, and none of them needs a solver except `em`:

- **The format.** `circuitrf reference 3d-view` prints the `.c3d` format, field by field, with a whole
  worked file. A 3D view can be written by hand, or by a script, as well as drawn.
- **`circuitrf check <path>`** — on the `.c3d`, the cell or the workspace: every object, name, expression,
  instance, port and setup, with each port's inferred polarity reported. The example checks clean.
- **`circuitrf explain <path.c3d>`** — how it elaborates: where each name's value came from, which
  technology each instance resolved through, every solid with its material and extent in metres, each
  port's contacts edge by edge, the air box, and an estimate of the problem's size.
- **`circuitrf render <path.c3d> --section xz@y=0mil -o cut.svg`** — a section through it; `--iso` for an
  isometric view. The pictures on this page are drawn that way. A section fills each object at its
  [transparency](#transparency); `--transparency lid=80` sets one (or a placed cell's, or every member of a group:
  `--transparency stage1=40`) for that picture alone, without editing the file.
- **Reference images** are drawn by `--iso`, as Copy as Vector draws them; a section draws none. `check` warns — never
  errs — on an image whose file is missing or will not read, a face image whose face is gone, and `Locked` on a sheet
  with no image. See [Reference images](#images).
- **`circuitrf em <path.c3d> --setup "Lid modes"`** — runs one setup, exactly as Run does, and writes the
  same files.
- **`circuitrf convert part.step -o Cell/3d/Cell.c3d`** — Import STEP into a new 3D view, each part's material by
  name or colour, or `--material <part>=<material>`; **`circuitrf convert x.c3d -o x.step`** — Export STEP, with the
  dialog's choices as flags. See [convert ▸ STEP, both ways](cli.html#convert-step).
- **`circuitrf convert x.c3d -o x.glb`** — Export glTF, with `--gltf-assembly` and `--gltf-field <plot>`; the camera is
  the Look's when the document saves one. See [convert ▸ glTF](cli.html#convert-gltf) and
  [Exporting for another renderer](#gltf).
- **Booleans, fillets, chamfers and Step parts by hand.** The `Boolean`, `Fillet`, `Chamfer` and `Step` objects are
  ordinary JSON in the `.c3d`, and `circuitrf reference 3d-view` prints every field; the rules for their names, faces,
  edges and `Hash` are in [File formats ▸ The 3D view's operations](file-formats.html#c3d-operations).

## Every control, in detail {#reference}

The sections above teach the editor through the example. This one is the reference: every control, in the
order a pane presents them, with the rules each one follows.

- **The line on the view**. One line at the bottom of the view is the editor's status line: what
  the armed tool wants next, or the last message — a refusal and its reason, or what an edit did. Where this chapter
  says *the status line* in the 3D editor, it means that line. The clip plane cuts the model, never the drawing grid.
- **Snapping**. The cursor snaps to a **vertex** (a square marker), an edge's **midpoint**
  (a triangle), the nearest point on an **edge** (an ×), a face's **centre** (a circle) and, when nothing is
  within reach, the **grid** (a small +) — the document's snap step on the drawing plane. A marker is drawn in
  the colour of the material it snaps to, and in amber on the grid or on an object with no material. A vertex wins over
  anything else in reach, even a nearer midpoint. Snapping reaches into placed cells, so a die's pad corner
  is a target in its package. Only what you can see is a target: a corner hidden behind a surface is not,
  except inside a translucent object or with the clip plane on. The snap distance is the layout editor's,
  in screen pixels, so it feels the same at every zoom. The magnet on the toolbar, and *3D ▸ Snap*, turn
  snapping on and off, and the buttons beside it turn each kind on and off; these are your settings, not the
  document's. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on a Mac) to suspend geometry snapping while it is held; the grid
  still applies. The marker's shape says what the cursor snapped to; the point itself is read with Measure (**M**).
  A **≈** before a point means it is not exactly a point of the document's database-unit grid: a corner of
  an object rotated by an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, or of a cell drawn at another scale.
- **Drawing**. Shapes are drawn on the **drawing plane** — XY, YZ or XZ, at an offset along
  its normal — chosen with the **XY / YZ / XZ** buttons and the offset box on the toolbar (a bare number is the
  document's unit; `25um` or `10mil` says its own), from *3D ▸ Drawing Plane*, from a face (*Drawing Plane
  from Face* on a face's menu in Face mode, or **Ctrl**-click a face — **Cmd**-click on a Mac — with a tool
  armed), or through a snapped point (**Ctrl/Cmd+Shift**-click moves the offset there and keeps the plane).
  Only axis-aligned faces make a plane; a tilted face is refused, naming its normal. Moving the camera never
  moves the plane, and a plane seen edge-on is refused rather than drawn on. The plane is remembered for the
  document in the workspace's window state, not in the `.c3d`. A faint **grid** lies on it, behind the
  objects, in steps of the document's unit — major lines every 10 minor ones, every 5 in mil and inch —
  spaced to stay readable at every zoom and fading away from the view's centre and when the plane is seen
  at a grazing angle; the lines through the origin are in the axis colours. The snap step is the **Snap** box beside **Unit** on
  the toolbar — the layout editor's control, with the same steps off the technology's default: pick one or type
  a length (`2.5mil`). It is saved in the document, and changing it moves nothing already drawn. The tools are on the toolbar, under *3D ▸ Draw*, and at the cursor with
  **Shift+A** — then one letter: **B**ox (corner, opposite corner, then its height), **S**heet (a rectangle,
  two clicks), Poly**g**on (a closed sheet, a click per vertex; click the first vertex, press Enter or
  double-click to close — an outline that crosses itself is refused and the crossing shown), Poly**l**ine
  (construction geometry; Enter or a double-click ends it, a click on its first vertex closes it) and
  C**y**linder (centre, radius, height) and Sph**e**re (centre, radius; centred on the plane, so the click is its
  centre). A box or cylinder rises along the plane's normal; near a
  neighbour's feature its height snaps to that feature, so a box rises to exactly the top of a pad. Every
  click snaps. While a shape is in progress, type a digit to enter a dimension instead of clicking — the
  box that opens at the cursor shows the width, depth, height or radius the next click would set; **Tab**
  moves between them, **Enter** accepts, **Esc** goes back to the mouse. An entry that is not a length stays
  in the box, in red, and nothing changes. **Esc** cancels a shape in progress; pressed again it puts the
  tool down. Each new object takes the material chosen on the toolbar and a name you can change
  (`box1`, `sheet1`, …); each is one undo step. **Extrude** (a sheet's menu, *3D ▸ Modify*, or a polyline
  selected in the tree) pulls a closed polyline, a polygon or a rectangle into a prism — move to set the
  distance and click, or type it — and consumes the source unless **K** says keep it. An open polyline
  extrudes to a flat ribbon when it is a straight line along an axis of its plane.
- **Moving and copying** (Object mode). The selection — objects, placed cells, or both — is
  moved, rotated and copied from its right-click menu or *3D ▸ Modify*. **G** moves it: click a **base
  point**, then a **target point**, both snapped, and the selection moves by the difference — two clicks
  put a pad's corner exactly on a trace's corner. Pressed with the cursor over the selection, **G** takes the
  snapped point under the cursor as the base at once. While moving, **X**, **Y** or **Z** holds the move to
  that axis (a snap still decides how far) and **Shift+X/Y/Z** to the plane across it; press the same key to
  let go. Type a digit to enter the distance (`dx`, `dy`, `dz`, or one distance along a held axis). **R**
  rotates about the drawing plane's normal (X, Y or Z changes the axis) through the selection's centre, or
  through a snapped point Ctrl/Cmd-clicked first, in 15° steps — hold **Shift** to turn freely, or type the
  angle. *Rotate 90°* and *Mirror* (across XY, YZ or XZ through the centre) act at once. **Ctrl+D**
  (**Cmd+D**) duplicates the selection and moves the copies; **Esc** cancels both. *Array…* makes copies
  along up to three axes at a pitch, shown as you type. *Align* lines the others up with the last one
  selected, by their minimum, centre or maximum on an axis. *Order* moves objects in the construction
  order — where two solids overlap, the later one wins, except that **metal always wins over a dielectric**
  whatever the order (an air object drawn after a metal still cuts a hole in it) — and the tree and the
  Properties panel show each object's place in it. The **gizmo** at the selection's centre moves it too: drag an arrow to move along
  that axis, or a square to move in that plane. While any of these runs nothing is changed yet; the
  selection moves on screen, and the document changes once, as one undo step, when you click or release. A
  rotation keeps an object what it was — a rotated box is still a box — and the file stores it as at most
  three turns. A result that is not a whole number of database units is rounded and the status line says
  **≈**.
- **Editing faces and vertices** (Face and Vertex modes). Right-click a face, or use *3D ▸
  Modify ▸ Face*. **N** (*Move Along Normal*) pushes or pulls the face: its plane moves and the faces around
  it keep theirs, stretching to meet it — push a box's top up and it is still a box, only taller. It stops
  just before a neighbour would shrink to nothing, and the status line names that neighbour (`'side2' would
  vanish at 1.2 mil`); a typed distance past that point is refused rather than shortened. **G** moves the face
  freely, base point to target point, with **X/Y/Z** and typed distances as for objects; the faces around it
  tilt to follow. **Shift+E** (*Extrude to New Solid*) grows a new solid from the face along its normal — a bump
  from a pad, a wall from a floor — in the toolbar's material, or the source's with **M**; the source is
  unchanged. *Align to Face…* then a click on another face moves the object until the two are in one plane:
  *Touching* (facing each other, a die on its substrate) or *Flush* (the same way), **T** switches, and the
  result is shown before the click; faces that are not parallel are refused (rotate first). *Copy as Sheet*
  makes a sheet exactly on the face. *Measure* puts the face's area, perimeter and outward normal in
  Properties; Shift-click a second, parallel face for the distance between them. In Vertex mode **G** moves the
  selected vertex, Properties' *Set coordinates* types where it goes, and *Measure From* starts a measurement
  there. **Every edit keeps the solid closed**: no face is ever removed, so there is no Delete in Face mode. A
  face that can no longer be flat is split into flat triangles, named after it (`top.0`, `top.1`), and anything
  attached to the face goes to every piece. An edit that would make the solid pass through itself is drawn in
  red and refused, naming the faces (`'top' would pass through 'bottom'`); nothing changes. A shape keeps its
  kind for as long as it can say the result with its own dimensions — a pushed box stays a box, a prism's top
  moved sideways is a slanted prism — and otherwise becomes a **polyhedron** with the same face names; the
  status line says so, and Undo takes it back. A cylinder's ends move only along its axis and its side only
  in radius, and in Vertex mode it offers just its two cap centres, which measure but do not move: *Convert to
  Polyhedron* (Object mode; for a cylinder, choose how many flat sides) makes every vertex editable. A sphere's
  one face, `surface`, is curved, so no face edit takes it — change its **Radius** in Properties — and its centre
  measures but does not move; it is not converted to a polyhedron, and a Boolean is how to cut one. While a
  face or vertex is dragged only that object is redrawn, and the document changes once, as one undo step,
  when you click.
- **Dimensions as expressions**. Wherever a dimension is typed — the box at the cursor while
  drawing, Properties, the Array panel — you may type a name or an expression instead of a number: `w`,
  `2*w`, `h_sub + t_met`, optionally followed by a unit (`2*w mil`); with none, the display unit is the
  expression's unit, and it is stored with the expression, so changing the display unit later moves nothing.
  The box shows the value as you type (`= 0.254 mm`), or `unknown: w`. Press Enter with an unknown name and a
  **Define** strip opens under the box, one row per name: a value (for a bare `w`, the size the rubber band
  shows now), a unit, and whether it becomes a **VAR of this 3D view** or a **cell parameter**; Enter defines
  them and the shape carries on, and the definitions and the new object are one undo step. A width, depth,
  height, radius or extrude distance keeps its expression; a polygon's points and a move's distance are
  evaluated once and stored as numbers, and the box says so. A number may carry its own unit (`2*w + 0.5mm`);
  one without that is added to a name with a unit takes the box's unit, so `2*w + 5` with `w` in mil is 25 mil,
  and a multiplier stays a number. A lone `m` is milli (`2mm` or `2metre`, never `2m`); `check` warns about any
  dimension over 1 m.
  The **Variables** panel (the *x* button) lists each VAR with its expression, unit, value and how many fields
  use it, then the cell's parameters. Each row's buttons are glyphs, named by their tooltips: *Set*, *Rename*
  (every use is rewritten; `ww` is not touched by renaming `w`), *Inline* (writes the current numbers into the
  fields that use it, then deletes it), *Promote to Cell Parameter*, and *Delete*, last — greyed while anything
  uses the VAR, its tooltip naming what does. Drag the panel's left edge to widen it. A VAR with the same name as a cell parameter is **linked** to it:
  it takes the parameter's value — an instance's override, else the cell's default — and editing it edits the
  parameter, so the cell has one default for the name. *Unlink* makes it keep its own value, which then hides
  the parameter from this 3D view (`check` warns). Placing a cell's 3D view, an instance can override its
  parameters in the file (`"Params"`); two instances with the same values are elaborated once.
  **Dragging** a face whose size is an expression changes the *name*, never the field: a bare VAR is given the
  new value, a parameter (or linked VAR) gets a new default, and an expression linear in one name (`2*w + gap`)
  solves for that name — and every other object using it moves with it, in the preview too. A drag of
  anything else (`2*w*l`) is refused, with *Replace with Number* offered. A move or rotation is refused when
  it would change a name another object uses, because only the selection moves while you drag.
- **Setups** (*Simulate ▸ Setup Analyses…* with a 3D view active, or the editor's tune button). A 3D view
  carries its own EM setups, in the same form a `.cem` has, and the dialog lists them as a schematic's
  analyses are listed — one card each, with its kind (SP, ES, MS or EIG) and its solver and sweep: *Add*,
  *Edit*, *Duplicate*, *Rename*, *Remove* and *Make Active*, also on each card's right-click menu with *Run*.
  The **active** setup (the filled radio mark) is the one *Simulate ▸ Run* runs and whose air box is drawn;
  which one is active is remembered per user, not saved in the `.c3d`. **Double-click** a card to edit that
  setup in the same panel a `.cem` opens, less the layout row (the 3D view is the geometry) and the planar
  analyses (a 3D view is solved by Palace or openEMS). Every change is an edit of the 3D view: Undo takes it
  back and Save writes it. A static setup's terminals name their conductors by **object** (`top`, or `U1/pad3` inside a
  placed cell), because a drawn object has no net. *Show 3D* on a `.cem` whose geometry is a `.c3d` opens this
  editor, with that `.cem` listed read-only and active, so its ports and boundaries can be seen.
- **Ports** (**P** in the Shift+A popup, or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Port*). A port is drawn like a sheet —
  two corners on the drawing plane — or made from a face: right-click a flat, rectangular face and choose
  *Make Port ▸ Lumped* or *Wave*. It takes the next free number and the last port's Z0. **Which way round it
  is comes from what it touches**: each edge of the rectangle is tested against every conductor, and exactly
  one pair of opposite edges must each touch exactly one conductor. The end that is ground — the setup's
  Ground net, a placed layout's ground plane, or a PEC face of the air box — is **−**; otherwise the larger
  conductor is. A lumped port is drawn as a checkerboard over exactly its own rectangle, − edge to + edge and
  its full width, with its number and a flat arrow painted on it pointing to +; while it is being drawn the
  arrow, or the reason it cannot be one, follows the cursor. Right-click a port for *Flip*, its kind, *Z0…*
  and *Delete*. A wrong polarity turns every transmission term by 180°, so check the arrow before a run.
  A **wave** port must lie on a face of the active setup's air box. Every setup uses every port, and a
  placed cell's own ports are never used: only the parent says where a signal enters.
- **Bond wires** (**W** in the Shift+A popup, or *3D ▸ Draw ▸ Wire*). A wire runs between two metal
  objects or sheets — a die's pad inside a placed cell to a lead in the package is the usual case, which a `.wBond`
  cannot do because it belongs to one layout. Click any face of the object the wire starts on: each end attaches to
  its object's **top**, above the point you clicked (a side face lands just inside the top's edge; a snapped corner or
  face centre on a top is taken exactly). An object with no material, or an insulator, is refused with the reason.
  Then click the object it ends on, then move to set the **loop height** and click, or type it (`8mil`). The
  loop height is the assembly one: from the top of the lower pad to the top of the wire at its highest point.
  The status line shows it and the wire's centre-line loop height side by side, and **the height you type is
  the height the wire measures**. Before the first click the toolbar sets the diameter, the metal, how each end
  is bonded (a **wedge** lays a foot on the pad, a **ball** sits on it) and the section (a flat-bottomed
  hexagon, or round); they start from the last wire drawn. A wire's points are its whole shape: in Vertex mode
  its centre-line points are shown and **G** moves one, and its feet are put back on the pads when you let go
  — an end moved to where there is no pad is refused. When the pad under a wire moves, the wire does **not**
  follow, because re-routing it would change its inductance: the wire is flagged in the tree, drawn in red,
  and a run says which end (`w3's start is no longer on a pad`). *Re-Seat Wire Ends* (right-click the wire, or
  select it in the tree and use *3D ▸ Modify*) moves each end up or down onto the pad now under it; a pad that moved sideways has to be reconnected by
  hand. *Duplicate* and *Array…* copy wires at a pitch, and a copy whose end misses a pad is still made and
  flagged, so a pitch error shows at once. Foot length and ball size come from the workspace's assembly rules
  (`.wasm`) unless the wire's end states a foot length, and the run says when a built-in first guess was used.
- **The air box** (the box button). The active setup's air box, its faces tinted by boundary: **PEC** grey,
  **PMC** orange, **symmetry** hatched, and **absorbing** clear. It is shown until you hide it. In Face mode its faces can be picked, but only where no solid is under the cursor (**B** reaches
  one behind a solid). Right-click one for *Boundary ▸ Absorbing / PEC / PMC / Symmetry* and *Padding…*:
  these change the **setup**, not the geometry, and the status line says which setup they wrote.
- **Boundaries on faces** (Face mode). Right-click a face of a dielectric or air object for
  *Boundary ▸ Perfect Conductor*, *Conductive Surface* (choose the metal) or *None*. The face is drawn tinted
  and listed in the tree under its object. A boundary stays with its face through every edit, and a face
  that is split into pieces hands it to each. A conductor's face takes none — it is already metal — and
  absorbing, PMC and symmetry boundaries belong to the air box, because both solvers can state them only on
  the outside of the problem. Palace finds a boundary's surfaces by the face's extent and counts them, so a
  neighbour's face lying in the same plane and overlapping it is refused rather than guessed.
- **Simulate** (*Simulate ▸ Run* with the 3D view active, or the toolbar's Run button — the workspace toolbar's). Runs the active setup with the
  same progress, Cancel and messages as a `.cem`, and opens its results in the Data Display. Afterwards the
  run's fields are drawn by the field plots, on the geometry the run solved, and the toolbar's mesh button shows the
  mesh the run made (it is greyed until there are fields to plot); if the 3D view, or any file the run was solved from,
  has changed since, a selected field plot's Properties say so and name it (`Fields are from the run at 14:02;
  'Board.clay' has changed since`) and the fields are still shown. A run keeps, beside its result, the document it solved
  and a hash of every file it read: each placed layout and the sub-cells it flattens, a layout's paired `.wBond`, each
  nested 3D view, the technology and the material libraries it looks through, and — for a thermal run driven from a
  circuit — the schematic, each sub-cell schematic and the S-parameter files it names. Editing a field plot is display
  and never makes a result stale. An object with **no material** yet — drawn as a wireframe — does not stop the run: the solver
  ignores it and the run's messages say so. One whose material the technology does not define does stop it.
