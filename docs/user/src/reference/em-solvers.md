circuitRF can solve an electromagnetic problem in three different ways, and each is a different
method, not a faster or slower version of the same one:

- **MoM**, the **method of moments**: circuitRF's own planar solver, built into the application.
- **FEM**, the **finite element method**: **Palace**, a separate open-source program that circuitRF runs.
- **FDTD**, the **finite-difference time-domain** method: **openEMS**, another separate open-source
  program that circuitRF runs.

They are chosen in one place, the **Solver** group of an EM setup: *Planar* (MoM), **FEM 3D (Palace)**,
**FDTD 3D (openEMS)**, or **FEM & FDTD - Compare**. The setup, the layout and the result are the same
kind of document whichever solves it. This page explains the three methods, and which problems each
one is good at and bad at. How to set each one up is in [EM Setup](em-setup.html#solver-3d),
[The MoM engine](mom-engine.html) and [3D EM](em-3d.html).

## The short answer {#short}

**Use the planar MoM solver whenever the structure is planar metal on a layered board or die.** That
covers most layout work. It is the fastest of the three and needs nothing installed. Go to 3D only for
what it cannot represent.

**Use FEM (Palace)** for curved or small metal in a 3D volume: bond wires, round vias, packages and
lids. Use it too when you need something only FEM gives you: a cavity's resonances (eigenmode), or a
capacitance or inductance matrix (electrostatic and magnetostatic).

**Use FDTD (openEMS)** for Manhattan metal on a stackup over a wide band, and for radiators whose air
box you want to keep small. It needs far less memory than FEM.

**Use both** (*FEM & FDTD - Compare*) when an answer matters and you want a second opinion. The two
methods share no numerics, so when they agree, each has probably converged.

## Three ways to discretise Maxwell's equations {#methods}

Every EM solver replaces the continuous field with a finite number of unknowns and solves for those.
The three methods differ in **where the unknowns are** and **whether they solve one frequency at a time
or step through time**. Almost every practical difference between them follows from those two choices.

### MoM: unknowns on the metal only {#mom}

The **method of moments** puts its unknowns on the **conductors only**: the current on each small cell
of metal. The air, the substrate and the ground plane are not meshed at all. They are built into the
**Green's function**, the formula for the field one piece of current makes everywhere else. circuitRF's
Green's function is for a **stack of laterally infinite layers over an infinite ground plane**, which is
what makes the method planar (often called 2.5D).

- **Every cell talks to every other cell**, so the matrix is **dense**: N unknowns cost N² numbers.
  Small N is the whole point: a microstrip bend needs a few hundred unknowns, where a volume mesh of
  the same bend needs hundreds of thousands.
- It solves **one frequency at a time**, and circuitRF's adaptive sampling picks which frequencies to
  solve.
- **Radiation into open space and the infinite substrate are exact**, with no box and no absorbing
  wall to place.
- It **cannot** represent anything the layer stack cannot: a board edge, a lid, a cavity wall, a wire
  arcing through air, a signal via passing through a reference plane, or a dielectric that stops
  somewhere. [The MoM engine ▸ Cannot](mom-engine.html#can-cannot) is the full list. circuitRF refuses
  such a structure by name rather than solving the wrong one.

### FEM: a tetrahedral mesh of the volume {#fem}

The **finite element method** fills the whole solved region — dielectrics, air, the space inside a
package — with **tetrahedra**, and solves for the field on each one. Metal is a boundary of that volume.
circuitRF builds the 3D model, **Gmsh** meshes it, and **Palace** solves it.

- **The mesh follows the geometry.** Tetrahedra fit a round wire, a slanted face or a curved via
  barrel. There is no staircase.
- **Each element talks only to its neighbours**, so the matrix is **sparse**. It is also far larger
  than a MoM matrix: hundreds of thousands to a million or more unknowns is normal.
- **Adaptive refinement.** After a solve, Palace estimates where the error is and subdivides only
  those elements, then solves again. Small elements end up where the answer needs them — around a
  wire, along a strip's edge — without anyone placing them by hand.
- It works **in the frequency domain**. A driven run's adaptive sweep solves a few frequencies in full
  and builds the rest of the band from them.
- **The same mesh answers other questions.** An **eigenmode** solve finds a structure's resonant
  frequencies and Q directly. **Electrostatic** and **magnetostatic** solves give capacitance and
  inductance matrices. Neither of the other two methods offers these in circuitRF.
- The volume must end somewhere, so the model sits in an **air box** whose faces are metal walls,
  symmetry planes or absorbing boundaries. Palace's absorbing boundaries are first order, so an open
  structure needs the box kept well away from it.

### FDTD: a grid, stepped through time {#fdtd}

The **finite-difference time-domain** method divides the region into a **rectilinear grid** of
rectangular cells and **steps the fields forward in time**: an electric-field update, then a
magnetic-field update, over and over. circuitRF builds the model and writes the grid itself; **openEMS**
runs the time stepping.

- **One run covers a whole band.** A short pulse contains every frequency in the sweep. After it has
  died away, the port voltages and currents are transformed into S-parameters at every frequency at
  once.
- **Memory is small.** A cell stores six field values and a few coefficients. There is no matrix to
  hold and nothing to factor.
- **The smallest cell sets the time step.** The **CFL condition** (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy) says a wave
  may not cross a cell in one time step, so one fine feature shrinks the time step of the entire model.
  A 25 µm wire in a 3 mm package means a small time step everywhere, and many more steps to cover the
  same time.
- **Metal aligned with the grid costs nothing; anything else is a staircase.** A diagonal edge or a
  round wire is approximated by grid cells, and matching a curved surface accurately takes a fine grid.
- **It has to wait for the energy to leave.** A run ends when the signals have died away. A lossy or
  well-matched structure rings down quickly. A **high-Q** cavity rings for a very long time, which is
  why a cavity's resonances are FEM's job, not FDTD's.
- **Absorbing boundaries are good.** openEMS's PML (perfectly matched layer) soaks up an outgoing wave
  over a few cells, so a radiator's air box can stay small.
- openEMS drives **one port per run**, so an N-port setup is N runs, one after another.

## Palace and openEMS: the two programs {#programs}

circuitRF **ships neither 3D solver and contains no code from either.** It runs them as separate
programs you install. The install assistant can do that for you (see
[3D EM ▸ Getting the solvers](em-3d.html#getting)), and so can `circuitrf solver install palace`.
Opening, editing and looking at a 3D model needs neither program. Only **Simulate** does.

**Palace** is a parallel finite-element code for full-wave 3D electromagnetics. It also has a
time-domain solver, which circuitRF does not use. **openEMS** is an FDTD solver. It is written for use
with its own geometry library, and circuitRF writes that library's model file directly. **Gmsh** is
the open-source mesh generator that turns circuitRF's 3D model into Palace's tetrahedra.

What circuitRF adds around both programs is the same: it **builds the 3D model** from your layout, its
technology and bond wires (or from a drawn [3D view](drawing-in-3d.html)), checks that the run fits in
memory, runs the solver, follows its progress from its log, and reads the answer back as an ordinary
result. [EM Setup](em-setup.html#solver-3d) has every setting.

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">What FDTD cannot say that FEM can</span>
<p>Two material limits of openEMS appear in every openEMS run's notes. A loss tangent is exact at one
frequency only, because openEMS holds a material's conductivity constant. And solid metal is a perfect
conductor, because a grid cannot resolve a skin depth; thin metal drawn as a sheet keeps its loss. On a
lossy substrate these are the largest expected differences between the two solvers. See
<a href="em-setup.html#openems-run">EM Setup ▸ Running openEMS</a>.</p>

## Is it speed? Is it memory? {#speed-memory}

**Both, and which one binds depends on the problem.** These are the figures circuitRF has measured.
Each is one machine's measurement — an Apple M4 with 10 cores and 16 GB — and yours will differ.

**MoM is fastest where it applies.** At 2,000 unknowns a frequency point solves in under a second and
holds 84 MB. At 5,000 it holds 527 MB, and that is the dense solver's ceiling: a larger mesh is refused
before it runs. The optional accelerated solve raises the ceiling to 12,000 on a single metal level
with no vias, using about four times less memory. Its cost grows fastest with **metal area and mesh
density**, not with the size of the box around the metal, because there is no box. See
[The MoM engine ▸ What makes a run infeasible](mom-engine.html#budget).

**FEM uses the most memory, and the memory is usually what limits it.** The shipped example's runs:

| Palace run (from [3D EM ▸ Walking through the example](em-3d.html#example)) | Wall time | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|
| A package's capacitance matrix, Standard | 8 s | 1.1 GB |
| A package's inductance matrix, Standard | 22 s | 1.8 GB |
| A via through a ground plane, 0.1–20 GHz, Draft | 62 s | 4.8 GB |
| One bond wire, Standard | 179 s | 3.1 GB |
| A package lid's resonances, eigenmode | 166 s | 1.7 GB |
| The same via, Standard | 35 min | 9.3 GB |

While the solvers were being chosen, hand-built Palace models found the practical limit of a 16 GB
machine at about **1.2 million second-order unknowns**. circuitRF checks a run's memory twice before it
solves: once from the model's volumes, and again from the element count Gmsh reports.

**FDTD uses far less memory than FEM, and the time step is usually what limits it.** In the same
solver-choice measurements, hand-built openEMS models of one bond wire reached Palace's answer to
within 0.1 dB at 10 GHz with **400,000 cells in 13 s and 67 MB**, where the Palace run of the same wire
took 108.5 s and 7.7 GB. That grid had cells of **half the wire's radius** around the wire, and at that
size the wire set the time step for the whole model. The same wire on a coarser grid read 26 % too much
inductance. A package with many wires is therefore FDTD's worst case: every wire needs a fine grid
around it, and the finest cell anywhere slows every step.

So the honest summary is:

- **Small metal in a large volume** (wires, a die in a package): FEM's adaptive mesh spends elements
  only where the field changes. FDTD's grid refines along whole lines and planes through the model, and
  its time step falls with the finest cell.
- **Large, simple, Manhattan structures over a wide band**: FDTD's one pulse and small memory win, and
  there is no matrix to factor.
- **Planar structures**: MoM wins both, often by orders of magnitude, because it does not mesh the
  volume at all.
- **Narrow resonances**: FEM, by eigenmode, finds a resonance directly. FDTD has to wait for it to ring
  down, and MoM cannot represent the enclosure.

## Choosing, by problem {#choosing}

| Problem | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Lines, bends, couplers, filters, spirals, MIM capacitors on a board or die | **MoM** | Planar metal in a layered stack is exactly what it models, in seconds |
| Vias stitching metal to ground | **MoM** | Vias are part of the planar model |
| A patch antenna on a large ground | **MoM**, or FDTD for a finite board | MoM's ground is infinite and exact; a real board's finite ground needs 3D — see [Antennas](antennas.html) |
| A signal via **through** a reference plane | **FEM** or **FDTD** | MoM refuses it: its return plane must lie below every conductor |
| Bond wires over one flat ground | **wBond**, then **FEM** | [wBond](wbond.html#fidelity)'s equations and kernel are far faster; curved, thin metal is FEM's strength, and FEM is their independent check |
| Bond wires over a ground step or split, in a cavity, under a lid | **FEM** | wBond's ground is one flat plane; FEM solves the ground you drew |
| A die in a package, leads, lids, connectors | **FEM** | Small features in an enclosed volume |
| "Is there a cavity resonance in my band?" | **FEM, eigenmode** | Finds each mode's frequency and Q directly |
| A package's capacitance or inductance matrix | **FEM, electrostatic or magnetostatic** | Only Palace computes them |
| A broadband Manhattan board structure: a transition, a launch, a stripline | **FDTD**, or FEM | One pulse covers the band, at little memory |
| A radiator that is not planar | **FDTD** or FEM | FDTD's PML keeps the box small; both give a pattern — [Antennas ▸ From a 3D solver](antennas.html#3d) |
| Any 3D answer you are about to rely on | **FEM & FDTD - Compare** | Two independent methods; agreement means each has converged |

When a 3D solver is chosen, the setup panel says which of the two suits the model's geometry. That is
advice, not a restriction.

**Heat is a fourth solve, and it is none of these.** A thermal setup on the same 3D model is solved by circuitRF's own
steady-conduction solver — no Palace, no openEMS — but **it needs Gmsh**, the mesher Palace uses, to mesh the solids. See
[Thermal](thermal.html).

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">Agreement is a cross-check, not a reference</span>
<p><b>FEM &amp; FDTD - Compare</b> runs both solvers on one model and writes their difference. Both read
the same model that circuitRF built, so a mistake in building it would appear in both answers. It checks
the solving, not the model. See <a href="em-setup.html#run-both">EM Setup ▸ Running both</a>.</p>

## What each solver sees of curved geometry {#curved}

A bore, a pin, a fillet, a chamfer at an angle: a 3D model is full of surfaces that are not flat and not aligned
with an axis. The two 3D solvers see them differently, and the difference follows from their methods.

- **Palace meshes the exact surface.** Gmsh reads the geometry kernel's own shape, not a faceted copy of it, and
  circuitRF asks for **second-order (curved) elements** — each tetrahedron's edges bend to lie on the surface — sized
  to the curvature: about twelve elements per full turn. What limits it
  is the **initial mesh**: a small radius forces small elements, and small elements cost unknowns. So Palace's note
  about a curved feature says how small its elements there will be and that the feature *will dominate the mesh* —
  and its setup's **Enabled** box on the feature is how to find out whether it matters.
- **openEMS staircases to its grid.** Its grid is rectilinear, so a curved surface is represented by the cells it
  fills: a bore becomes a staircase, and a feature smaller than about **one cell** is not represented at all — a
  fillet of 100 µm on a grid of 110 µm cells is solved as a sharp edge. Refining the grid converges a staircase; it
  cannot make the grid follow the surface. Its note per kernel object names the worst feature: *will not represent*
  (the cell is wider than the radius), *staircases … with about N cells* (a warning below four), or that refining
  the grid converges it.

**Where the notes appear.** Under each setup in *Simulate ▸ Setup Analyses…* (the 3D editor's Setups panel), in
`circuitrf check` at their own severity — they never change its exit code — and in the run's messages. None of them
stops a run.

{{ui: em3d-connector-setups}}

**What to change.** A feature openEMS will not represent needs a **finer grid near it**, or it needs **Palace**. In the
setup's openEMS section, more cells per wavelength refines the grid everywhere, and a smaller grading ratio keeps the
cells small further from a part's own edges. The grid beside a small part is set by that grading, not only by the
wavelength: the connector below still had a 113 µm cell at its pin's tip at 30 cells per wavelength. A feature Palace says dominates its mesh can be
switched off with its **Enabled** box to see what it costs and what it changes.

### Measured: a connector pin's fillet {#curved-measured}

The **3D Connector** example (*Tools ▸ Examples ▸ 3D Connector*) asks the question with numbers. A 0.4 mm pin in a
1.34 mm PTFE bore — 50.06 Ω by the coaxial closed form — launches onto a 62 mil line on 20 mil of laminate — 49.85 Ω
by Hammerstad and Jensen's — and the pin's tip is rounded by a 0.1 mm fillet. Those two impedances are closed-form
references; everything below is the solvers' output. Each setup ran twice, the fillet enabled and disabled, over 2–18
GHz, on an Apple M4 with 10 cores and 16 GB:

| Run | Time | Size | \|S11\| at 10 GHz | \|S11\| at 18 GHz |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Palace (Draft), fillet | 1 min 10 s | 4.0 GB | −16.71 dB | −40.75 dB |
| Palace (Draft), no fillet | 1 min 9 s | 4.3 GB | −16.69 dB | −40.90 dB |
| Palace, element order 2, fillet | 10 min 43 s | 10.1 GB | −18.55 dB | −31.95 dB |
| Palace, element order 2, no fillet | 8 min 32 s | 10.7 GB | −18.53 dB | −32.20 dB |
| openEMS (default grid), fillet | 1 min 45 s | 510,291 cells | −18.23 dB | −23.48 dB |
| openEMS (default grid), no fillet | 1 min 34 s | 449,748 cells | −18.32 dB | −24.32 dB |
| openEMS, 30 cells per wavelength, fillet | 4 min 46 s | 692,300 cells | −18.73 dB | −22.76 dB |

- **Palace sees the fillet** — it meshes it with elements of about 52 µm — and finds it changes |S11| by at most 0.25
  dB, at 18 GHz where the match is 32 dB down, with the same sign at both element orders, and |S21| by under 0.001 dB.
  At this band a 0.1 mm rounding on a 0.4 mm pin is **electrically negligible**.
- **openEMS does not see it**: the cell at the tip is 110.688 µm, and its warning says the edge is solved as sharp.
  Its two runs differ by 0.84 dB at 18 GHz because the fillet's faces add grid lines of their own — the grid moved, not
  the geometry — and one step of grid refinement moves |S11| there by 0.72 dB on its own. A difference no larger than
  the grid's own refinement spread is the grid's, and that is the honest answer to *does openEMS respect a fillet?*:
  not one under a cell.
- **Neither |S11| is converged at the settings a first run uses**: element order alone moves Palace's by up to 8.8 dB
  at the deepest null. |S21| is steadier: Palace −0.246 dB (Draft) and −0.207 dB (order 2) at 10 GHz, −0.518 dB and
  −0.503 dB at 18 GHz; openEMS −0.118 dB and −0.429 dB. The difference between the two solvers there is named by the run
  itself: openEMS writes the metals as perfect conductors, since an FDTD grid does not resolve a skin depth, so its
  answer has no conductor loss.

The example's README has every setting behind these numbers, and `expected-numbers.json` beside it records every
frequency of the shipped runs, which circuitRF's own regression test holds.

## Why not just one? {#why-three}

Because **no one method is best at everything**, and the problems an RF designer meets span all three.

- **Why MoM, when a 3D solver can do everything a planar one can?** Because on planar structures —
  most of layout work — it is seconds against minutes and megabytes against gigabytes, and it needs
  nothing installed. A 3D solver has to mesh the air and the substrate that MoM gets for free from its
  Green's function. MoM is the default; 3D is for what it cannot represent.
- **Why FEM?** For geometry that is neither planar nor Manhattan, where adaptive refinement puts
  elements only where they are needed. And for the questions only it answers in circuitRF: resonances,
  and capacitance and inductance matrices.
- **Why FDTD as well?** Because on the structures it suits — broadband and Manhattan — it is fast and
  uses very little memory. It is also the independent check on FEM. The two share no numerics, so
  their agreement means something that re-running one solver on a finer mesh cannot.

The three also check each other. circuitRF's solvers were validated this way: wBond's wire kernel
against Palace, the planar patch against a 3D run of the same patch, and Palace and openEMS against each
other and against closed forms. [3D EM](em-3d.html) and [Antennas](antennas.html#3d) give the numbers.
